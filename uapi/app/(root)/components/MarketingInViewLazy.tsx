// A tiny utility component that renders its children only once they scroll
// into (or near) the viewport.  Until then it returns `null`, which means the
// wrapped subtree is **never mounted** and therefore none of its JavaScript
// is executed or downloaded (when using `next/dynamic`).
//
// The previous implementation depended on `framer-motion`’s `useInView` hook.
// While convenient, that pulled the entire framer-motion runtime (~35 KB
// gzipped) into the marketing page’s main bundle because this component is
// rendered above the fold.  We replace it with a minimal custom hook that uses
// the browser’s native IntersectionObserver API.  This removes framer-motion
// from the critical path; the library is still code-split into the few below-
// the-fold sections that truly need it.
