# Bitcode Spec V32 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V32`
- V32 state: canonical promotion complete; V32 parity truth, generated proof artifacts, gate closure, and promotion automation are aligned
- Current canonical/latest target: `V32`
- Canonical proof-source commit: `1ec49a9ed5fa5db1da5fbd2388e528b91b98321f`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V31.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V31_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: active canonical `.bitcode/v32-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v32-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v32-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, `.bitcode/v32-proof-coverage-matrix.json`, `.bitcode/v32-artifact-volatility-inventory.json`, `.bitcode/v32-deterministic-replay-report.json`, `.bitcode/v32-reading-pipeline-proof-coverage.json`, `.bitcode/v32-ledger-btd-settlement-failure-state-coverage.json`, `.bitcode/v32-interface-contract-regression-suite.json`, `.bitcode/v32-browser-accessibility-responsive-visual-proof.json`, `.bitcode/v32-testnet-mainnet-readiness-rehearsal.json`, `.bitcode/v32-promotion-proof-generation-hardening.json`, `.bitcode/v32-promotion-readiness-report.json`, V32 gate-quality and promotion workflow evidence, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V32_PROVEN.md` as the generated proof appendix for V32 promotion
- Source parity state: V32 source-side proof/test replay, generated artifacts, Reading pipeline proof coverage, ledger/BTD failure-state proof, interface regression, browser/accessibility/responsive/visual proof, readiness rehearsal, workflow, and promotion surfaces are canonicalized in the promoted V32 file family
- State: draft target parity matrix opened
- Active canonical pointer during draft opening: `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` -> `V31`
- Scope: V32 canonical parity ledger for provation/testing over promoted Terminal, Reading, Protocol/BTD, Auxillaries, MCP, ChatGPT App, API, ledger/database/object-storage, and protocol-demonstration rails
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V32.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V32_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V32_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: none until V32 promotion
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V32`

## Purpose

The V32 parity matrix prevents proof work from becoming ceremonial.
Every V32 gate must name the promoted behavior being proved, the package/interface owner, the fixture or replay source, the validation command, the generated artifact, the source-safety class, and the failure or repair posture that must be covered before closure.

## completion condition

Gate 1 is complete when the V32 draft family validates, `check:v32-gate1` passes, workflow posture is V32-aware, README and roadmap reflect V32 initiation, V33-V37 scopes are current enough to guide future gates, diff hygiene passes, and the gate branch is committed, pushed, and pull-requested for review into `version/v32`.

Gate 2 is complete when `.bitcode/v32-proof-coverage-matrix.json` exists, is deterministic from `pnpm run generate:v32-proof-coverage-matrix`, enumerates all required promoted surfaces with owner package/interface, fixture, replay command, expected artifact, source-safety class, coverage status, required contexts, failure mode, and repair posture, preserves explicit `planned-gap` blockers, passes `pnpm run check:v32-gate2`, is wired into gate-quality CI, and the gate branch is committed, pushed, and pull-requested for review into `version/v32`.
