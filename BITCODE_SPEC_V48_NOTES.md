## Notes-only draft rule

These notes make the V48 draft target visible to strict spec-quality checks
after V47 promotion. They are not first-gate implementation authority, not a
full V48 specification family, and not permission to bypass the V47 canon. V48
work must continue by exercising the live commercial testnet experience
interactively, recording accepted findings, creating an explicit parity
matrix, and then opening scoped gate branches only after the QA-driven
specification intent is clear.

## Deferred from V47

V47 promoted commercial website testnet launch readiness. It launch-froze
`/deposit`, `/read`, `/packs`, and Auxillaries, made measurement law and the
IP seller/buyer state machines exact, completed the depositor and reader
websites, the packs/Auxillaries commercial dashboard, browser-proven E2E IP
selling and buying, landing/public launch messaging, the staging-testnet
deployment rehearsal, and promotion readiness — all over the preserved
Bitcoin/BTC settlement language, BTD scalar-volume and rights language,
GitHub delivery boundaries, compute constraints, storage boundaries, and
build/process validation carried from the promoted V46 comprehension canon.

V48 begins from the remaining question: what does the first live commercial
(testnet) experience still need before real users can walk every core step
without friction. The opening posture is intentionally experiential: run the
deployed staging-testnet system end to end, step by step, and fix what breaks.

## Candidate V48 workstreams

- Environment preparation: staging Supabase database readiness, wallet-fauceted
  testnet BTC, local telemetry expectations, and a step-by-step debugging
  experience that validates each core user step.
- Identity and authentication: sign up/in, and Auxillaries readiness for
  connecting GitHub, wallet(s), and other external surfaces.
- Depositing: connecting knowledge, requesting AssetPack syntheses to review,
  reviewing, and depositing.
- Reading: connecting knowledge, requesting a Read, reviewing the synthesized
  Need, reviewing potential Fits, and buying Fit(s).
- Ledgerized journaling: replayability, auditability, `/packs` page UX/UI, and
  the personal (Auxillaries) history of work.

## V48 Gate 1 in progress: identity and authentication interactive QA

Gate 1 exercises the live commercial testnet experience exactly as the
notes-only rule directs: interactively, recording accepted findings in
`BITCODE_V48_QA.md` (F1-F10 so far), and landing fail-closed repairs on the
gate branch. The full draft family is authored at Gate 1 closure from this
QA-driven specification intent.

Accepted findings converted to repairs so far:

- Supabase `redirect_to` law: GoTrue validates the Auth redirect allow-list by
  exact string match, so `redirect_to` must stay query-free. The post-auth
  destination travels through origin-local storage
  (`uapi/lib/supabase-auth-redirect.ts`) and is consumed once by the callback.
  This repaired wallet sign-in from both localhost and production www, which
  previously stranded the PKCE verifier and never minted a session.
- Identity-derived wallet binding: the canonical wallet sign-up signs on the
  OAuth provider authorize page, so nothing is staged client-side to replay.
  `/api/wallet/authenticate` now derives the binding server-side from the
  session's GoTrue-verified `custom:bitcode-bitcoin` identity
  (`source: 'oauth-identity'`), and `WalletSessionPersistenceBridge` triggers
  it whenever a wallet-backed session has no replayable local proof.
- Post-auth landing is `/packs`, not the legacy `/terminal` overlay route.

Specification intent surfaced for the eventual V48 family (decisions, not yet
law): eradicate legacy email/phone authentication residue (`/login`,
`LoginForm`, PhoneSSO) and the legacy `/terminal` route after verifying its
capabilities ported to `/packs`, `/read`, and `/deposit`; decide the
solo-operator organization-authority posture (personal-organization bootstrap
at wallet sign-up versus a neutral unconfigured state); complete the GitHub
App sessionless install staging path, whose pending-installation cookie
currently has no consumer.

## V48 Gate 2 in progress: depositing interactive QA and the AssetPacksSynthesis refactor

Gate 2 (branch `v48/gate-2-depositing-interactive-qa`) is explicitly the
significant-refactoring gate and a critical gate for the commercial viability
of Bitcode: interactive depositing QA exposed that deposit AssetPack option
"synthesis" was deterministic blueprint scaffolding (`BITCODE_V48_QA.md`
F12), and the accepted repair is architectural, not cosmetic. Gate 2's
charter (Garrett, 2026-06-12): consolidate Bitcode's pipelines into the
single AssetPacksSynthesis pipeline (plural Packs — one run can create
multiple packs), clean all legacy terminal code, and correct the incomplete
pipeline-execution actualities (real data, the Vercel sandbox actually
running pipelines, real accounting) so V48 QA reaches real demonstrability
of information commoditization — the ability to exchange knowledge,
fundamentally unlocked by measurement. The implementation builds maturely on
the existing strong primitives (prompts, registries, executions) and
generics (agents, pipelines) rather than inventing parallel machinery.

Accepted V48 architecture law (decided 2026-06-12):

- Bitcode has a single synthesis/measurement pipeline: **AssetPacksSynthesis**
  (`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/asset-packs-synthesis.ts`). Depositing
  and Reading are the same operation at the core — measuring source knowledge
  into commercially legible AssetPack candidates — with variance carried
  entirely by the lens: steering prompts (depositor instructions versus read
  Need), the available measurement catalog (deposit: source-coverage /
  demand-alignment / reuse-likelihood; read adds need-fit), and candidate
  framing. Measurement is the heart of Bitcode's commodification capability,
  so it is centralized in this one pipeline; lens adapters translate
  lens-specific contracts to and from the core. The deposit lens shipped in
  Gate 2; the reading lens migrates onto the core when Track 3 opens.
- Deposit option synthesis is real: `POST /api/deposit/synthesize-options`
  builds an exclusion-filtered source inventory from the depositor's
  connected GitHub source, runs bounded structured inference, persists the
  execution with real token/duration accounting, and emits options that keep
  the promoted V43/V47 option law (schema, roots, review boundaries,
  source-safety posture) so policy and admission consume them unchanged.
- Protected-IP exclusions are first-class synthesis steering: excluded paths
  and concepts never enter measurement, prompts, or option summaries, and
  candidates that touch them are dropped fail-closed (F14).
- Legacy `/terminal` code is refactored out as it is encountered during gate
  work (rule accepted 2026-06-12), with the dedicated F8 sweep retiring the
  remainder.

## V48 Gate 3 in progress: synthesis pipeline algorithmic + telemetric correctness, and the SynthesizeAssetPacks SDIVF unification

Gate 3 (branch `v48/gate-3-synthesis-pipeline-correctness`) is the synthesis
pipeline correctness gate, driven by interactive QA of the deposit synthesis
telemetry. It pursues both algorithmic correctness (the pipeline runs on the
real Bitcode execution/agent/prompt primitives rather than a hand-rolled
inference loop) and telemetric correctness (every LLM call renders decipherably
in the rich SDIVF telemetry), and in doing so unifies and formalizes the
pipeline.

Accepted V48 architecture law (decided 2026-06-25):

- The Gate-2 AssetPacksSynthesis measurement core is generalized into the
  one-and-only Bitcode synthesis pipeline: **SynthesizeAssetPacks** — a full
  **SDIVF** pipeline (Setup -> Discovery -> Implementation -> Validation ->
  Finish, with the Discovery/Implementation/Validation loop iterating up to a
  bounded maxIterations) executed in one of two **modes**: deposit or read.
  The mode is resolved once and stored on the **shared pipeline execution** (the
  parent of all phase children), NOT on a phase sibling — `sequential` runs
  preprocess and each phase on isolated sibling child executions
  (`execution.child('seq-N')`) and mode resolution only walks ancestors, so a
  mode stored inside preprocess is invisible to the phases (QA F20: they default
  to read and run the read-lens agents during a deposit run). All variance is
  carried by **conditional runtime registries** — each phase registers and
  resolves the mode-appropriate agents, tools, and prompts under the same phase
  keys (the registry is shared up the execution tree, so a phase's registrations
  are visible to its agent resolution). Renamed SynthesizeAssetPacks for parity with the future
  Gate-6 **SettleAssetPacks** pipeline; it subsumes the legacy, poorly-named
  "Develop" gate (which remains a thin alias so its `develop.*` observability
  is unchanged).
- Every LLM call builds upwards the prompt registry of
  Pipeline+Phase+Agent+Step+Generation and runs on the formal primitives, not
  hand-rolled inference: `PipelineExecution` -> phase -> `factoryAgent`/
  `factoryAgentWithPTRR` -> step -> Failsafe(prepare|chunk|stitch) of
  Thricified(reason|judge|structured_output). The pipeline is N agents
  (mostly PTRR, some Simple — both are base `Agent` implementations) across the
  5 phases; each PTRR agent renders 4 steps x 3 failsafe x 3 thricified = 36
  formal LLM calls. Every call renders in the rich SDIVF telemetry with correct
  phase/agent/step/failsafe/generation labels, because the formal executors
  populate the execution state (the lightweight path's `undefined` labels were
  a symptom of bypassing them).
- **Inference is non-configurable** (Garrett, 2026-06-26; removes the PROFILE
  concept entirely). There are NO inference profiles (no bounded/full, no
  `BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE_PROFILE`, no per-agent `*_USE_PTRR` flags,
  no in-agent deterministic/bounded fallbacks). The formal pipeline ALWAYS runs
  the complete hierarchy and the lowest-level Generation ALWAYS performs real
  inference — the hierarchy is fixed, not env-switched. Determinism for tests is
  provided ONLY by mocking the LLM provider at the boundary (test infrastructure),
  never by branches inside the pipeline. This retires
  `runtime-inference-policy` (the profile/`shouldUsePtrr` functions),
  `bounded-structured-inference`, and the read-lens agents' deterministic
  branches; every agent resolves to its `factoryAgent*` formal executor.
- **SynthesizeAssetPacks executes via the pipeline HARNESS, decoupled from the
  dispatching request** (Garrett, 2026-06-26). Because the pipeline always runs
  the full hierarchy (many LLM calls), it must not be bound to a single HTTP
  request's `maxDuration`. The route VALIDATES + DISPATCHES a run and returns the
  `runId` immediately; the harness runs the full pipeline to completion while
  source-safe telemetry streams to `execution_events`; the client detects the
  completion event (already streamed) and reads the persisted synthesis from the
  execution row `output`. Two execution hosts behind one harness interface:
  **local in-process** (dev — the persistent Node server runs the dispatched
  pipeline as a background task) and the **Vercel Sandbox** (prod — durable
  isolated execution via the existing `pipeline-hosts` host). The `/deposit`
  synthesize-options surface stops awaiting the pipeline inline; the LLM-call
  timeout (QA F25) remains a per-call safety bound within the harness run.
- Per-phase jobs (Garrett, 2026-06-25): **Setup** clones the repository and
  runs a danger-wall (safety/risk admission); **Discovery** explores the
  source; **Implementation** synthesizes the AssetPacks; **Validation**
  determines synthesis quality, corrections/additions, and the iterate-vs-
  complete decision; **Finish** uploads the synthesized artifacts.
- **Finish uploads the synthesized artifacts to Bitcode for user review in
  BOTH modes** (deposit: before Depository admission; read: before purchase).
  Opening a pull request is NO LONGER part of synthesis — PR / settlement
  delivery moves to the future Gate-6 SettleAssetPacks pipeline (confirm BTC
  payment, mint BTD, transfer rights to the reader). Develop-gate consumers
  degrade gracefully to no-PR.
- The deposit lens now RUNS the full SDIVF pipeline inline from
  `POST /api/deposit/synthesize-options` against the streaming execution, so the
  SDIVF telemetry renders end to end; the bounded-structured-inference path
  remains a resilience fallback when the pipeline yields no admissible options.
- Source-safety is enforced universally by `sourceSafeStreamEvent`, the single
  content-withholding gate every persisted/streamed pipeline event passes through.
  It withholds by **metadata allowlist**, not a content-key denylist: every `llm`
  store is content-withheld (message → `[content withheld — source-safe]`, data →
  a structural summary of {stage, generation, provider, model, contentChars,
  phase, agent, step}) EXCEPT a fixed source-safe metadata set
  (`startTime/endTime/duration/usage/status/provider/model/configKey/stopReason/
  error`). The allowlist is required because the two LLM-call paths name their
  content keys differently — the Thricified substeps use `input/prompt/output/
  parsedOutput`, while `AgentLLMsRegistry`/`PipelineLLMRegistry` (direct `getLLM`)
  use `messages/config/response` — and a denylist silently leaked `llm/response`
  (the raw provider response) as a status-event message (QA F18). A
  synthesis-local defense-in-depth candidate assertion remains; `rawPromptVisible`
  / `rawProviderResponseVisible` stay false by law.
- Telemetry rendering is single-line and bounded: the activity builder collapses
  every event to exactly one bounded line (one streamed event = one accordion
  row, never fragmented by embedded newlines) and the log row title spans carry
  `min-w-0` so a long line truncates within its row rather than x-overflowing the
  page (QA F18). The log auto-follows: it pins to the latest line as rows stream
  in unless the user has scrolled away from the bottom (then it respects their
  position and resumes only when they return to the bottom) (QA F23).
- **Formal telemetry log-line contract** (QA F19): the rich telemetry renders
  EXACTLY two formal log-line kinds — the ultimate LLM-call layer and Tool uses,
  nothing else (informational status, phase banners, and completion/error notices
  are NOT rows: run completion shows via the processing indicator and errors via
  the log's error banner). (1) **LLM calls** — the inference leaf, canonically the
  Thricified substep output (`llm/output`, stream type `generation`), carrying the
  full hierarchy Phase→Agent→Step→Failsafe→Thricified + source-safe content +
  provider/model/usage, each level its own pill. (2) **Tool uses** —
  `tool|tools:result|error`, carrying Phase→Agent→Step + tool name/arguments (no
  Failsafe/Thricified). Pills map by fixed role: Phase (grey, phase icon) top-left,
  Agent (blue, agent icon) top-2nd; Step / Failsafe / Thricified bottom 1-2-3, each
  with a guaranteed icon (per-type default refined by a label substring match).
  Every other store event (step/agent/phase name stores,
  prompt-side llm keys, the `llm/response` registry copy, cwd paths, generation
  markers, tool sub-keys) is intermediate CONTEXT: the activity builder folds it
  into a rolling `{phase, agent, step, failsafe, generation}` context (so the next
  LLM/tool row is stamped with its full hierarchy) but never emits it as a row.
  Distinct calls that share withheld text stay distinct rows via a unique
  null-separated row key; the renderer displays the text before the separator,
  keys details by the full key, and bypasses de-dup for uniquely-keyed rows. This
  is what removes the `try`/`setup-plan`/`thricified-generation`/path fragments
  and stabilizes the pipeline↔UI payload contract. The contract depends on the
  client seeing the SAME structured event shape live as on reload: the live SSE
  tail (`usePipelineExecution`) therefore relays raw `event_data` verbatim
  (namespace/key/executionState intact) rather than re-parsing it — re-parsing
  flattened events into namespace-less status frames, which defeated the
  classifier and leaked every store as a fragment row during streaming.
- **OTF (on-the-fly instructions) is eradicated entirely** as legacy residue:
  the dead telemetry types (`otf_instructions`/`otf_adherence`), the unused
  `setOnTheFly` prompt primitive, the live instruction-injection feature (the
  instructions API + the `run_otf_instructions` ORM model + the submit UI + the
  `waitForInstruction` Validation-phase pause), and the physical
  `deliverable_pipeline_otf_instructions` table (drop migration).

AssetPack model (decided 2026-06-25):

- An **AssetPack is ALWAYS a completely synthesized artifact** — never a slice of
  existing source. It comprises: the synthesized **patch** (new content written
  as code edits to the repo — deposit: the depositing repo; read: the reading
  repo), its **measurements**, and its **metadata** (e.g., the contributing
  AssetPacks for a pack synthesized for a Need). Implementation synthesizes the
  patch into the Setup-cloned workspace (via a code-edit/write tool), measures it,
  and attaches the metadata; the patch CONTENT is withheld pre-settlement.
- **Deposit** AssetPacks are "Readless/Needless": patches against the
  **depositing** repo carrying only **absolute** measurements (taken by looking
  at the content directly, independent of any Need). Depositing produces them as
  Depository supply.
- **Read** AssetPacks are patches against the **reading** repo, synthesized from
  the deposited AssetPacks that fit-finding selects from the Depository (the
  deposited packs are the synthesis input). A read AssetPack carries the absolute
  measurements PLUS the **fit** measurements (how well the pack fits the read
  Need). Its **BTD** — what is bought for Bitcoin — is the **normalized scalar
  weighted sum of all fit-only measurements**; the reader's Need unlocks the
  additional fit measurements that finalize the pack's BTD content.
- Measurement + BTD grounding (mapped 2026-06-25): the canonical V48 measurement
  catalogs live in `packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/asset-packs-synthesis.ts`.
  **Absolute** (deposit): source-coverage (0.36) / demand-alignment (0.40) /
  reuse-likelihood (0.24). The read catalog adds the **fit-only `need-fit`**
  (0.44) alongside source-coverage (0.28) / reuse-likelihood (0.28). The BTD
  scalar is computed in `btd-scalar-volume-quote.ts` under the fixed-point
  weighted-volume policy `need-relative-fixed-point-weighted-volume`
  (weightScaleBps 10000, volumeScale 1e6, floor-row-remainder-rooted):
  `scalarMicroBtd = volume × weightBps × admittedFitQualityBps / 1e8` per
  measurement, summed and normalized — a read AssetPack's BTD is this sum over its
  fit-only measurements. The read Need pricing vector
  (semantic_relevance / source_binding / artifact_kind_fit / closure_specificity)
  is in `read-need.ts`. The patch is carried as `fileChanges` + the source binding
  (covered paths) with the actual patch CONTENT withheld pre-settlement (the
  source-safe preview boundary; content unlocks to owner_read / licensed_read on
  settlement). `protocol-demonstration/` is the V47 realization framework (type
  contracts, receipt schemas), NOT the V48 measurement source of truth.

Lens inputs (decided 2026-06-25): the single-prompt user input is
**Obfuscations** when depositing (what to obfuscate/withhold — supersedes the
"depositor instructions" naming) and a **Need** when reading. Depositing and
reading run ~the same agents; the lens carries the variance by adding the Need
(read) or the Obfuscations (deposit).

The five phases (same agents in both modes, lens-varied — decided 2026-06-25):

- **Setup**: clone the repository, danger-wall (risk admission), and
  **input-comprehension** (comprehend the Need when reading / the Obfuscations
  when depositing). The deposit input-comprehension produces structured
  obfuscation guidance — the source paths and concepts to withhold and how
  synthesis must honor them — stored at `setup:inputComprehension` for the
  downstream phases (authoritative alongside the protected-IP exclusions). The
  read Setup-plan agent (planning Finding Fits from an accepted Read-Need) is
  read-lens work and is punted under the deposit lens (a passthrough, no row);
  that fits-finding planning moves to the read-lens **Discovery** phase in the
  read gate (QA F22).
- **Discovery** — three agents discovering from the codebase, the Depository, and
  the model itself respectively, for the synthesis lens:
  - `discovery:codebase-comprehension` — comprehends the cloned source.
  - `discovery:depository-search` — deposit: guides likely-to-be-read framing for
    the packs being synthesized; read: finds the deposited AssetPacks from the
    Depository that fit (will help synthesize the read AssetPack).
  - `discovery:inherent-regurgitation` — the model returns, from its training
    data, any and all information useful to the deposit/read synthesis.
  - Deposit stores each agent's comprehension for the Implementation phase:
    `discovery:codebaseComprehension` (capabilities / knowledge-areas / modules),
    `discovery:depositorySearch` (likely-read topics / demand-alignment /
    readability), `discovery:inherentRegurgitation` (relevant knowledge / patterns
    / references).
- **Implementation**: synthesize the AssetPack patch(es) with their absolute
  measurements (read additionally computes the fit measurements and the BTD).
  Each candidate is a measured patch — the measured option fields plus a
  SOURCE-SAFE patch descriptor (`fileChanges` [path + change-op] and a
  natural-language `patchSummary`), recorded via the `AssetPackPatchWriteTool`
  (a formal `ExecutionTool`) which the synthesis agent reads from the Discovery
  stores (`discovery:codebaseComprehension` / `:depositorySearch` /
  `:inherentRegurgitation`) and the obfuscation comprehension. Pre-settlement the
  RAW patch content is never produced — only the descriptor + measurements are
  reviewable (stored at `implementation:assetPacks`; the reviewable face at
  `implementation:options`). Physical materialization of the raw content into the
  cloned workspace is the delivery/settlement context.
- **Neediness (deposit preview of read Need-fit; v0)**: a deposit-lens AssetPack
  PREVIEW measurement (0..1) estimating the reading demand the pack would satisfy
  — the depositor's preview of its future read-side `need-fit` (and ultimately
  BTD / earnings), which guides which packs are worth synthesizing. It is SEPARATE
  from the absolute deposit composite (source-coverage / demand-alignment /
  reuse-likelihood) — an estimate of a different (read) lens, shown alongside but
  not folded in. Computed deterministically per pack as
  `neediness = clamp01(demand × (0.5 + 0.5 × (1 − saturation)))` from two
  source-safe signals the depository-search lens supplies: `demand` ∈ [0,1]
  (estimated reading demand for the pack's knowledge — v0: the Discovery
  `depository-search` demand guidance / `demandAlignment`, grounded in the
  depositor `demandContext`) and `saturation` ∈ [0,1] (how much the Depository
  already supplies the topic — v0: the depository-search `underservedTopics`
  signal). Demand gates, scarcity boosts: a demanded, underserved pack scores
  highest (a future Need would have few alternatives, you the supplier); a
  saturated or undemanded pack scores low. The deposit synthesis agent emits the
  per-pack `needinessSignal {demand, saturation, rationale}`; `computeNeediness`
  derives the scalar in the shared lib (`asset-packs-synthesis.ts`); the `/deposit`
  option cards preview it as earning potential. Source-safe: derived scalars +
  topic descriptors only, never raw source. **v1 is deferred to Gate 7**: replace
  `saturation` with a real embedding-vector probe of the pack against the
  Depository supply index, and `demand` with a search against an accrued
  Read-Need / demand corpus; once the pack is read, the realized read `need-fit`
  + BTD calibrate the estimate.
- **Validation**: quality thresholds, coverage/corrections/fixes, and AssetPack
  smoke/sanity checks; the Discovery/Implementation/Validation loop iterates until
  complete or maxIterations. The deposit validator (`validation:deposit-quality`)
  validates the synthesized AssetPacks — measurement honesty (0..1), distinctness,
  source-safety, obfuscation/exclusion compliance, patch-descriptor coherence, and
  coverage — emitting `{issues, qualityScore, coverageGaps, recommendation}`. Its
  issues are stored at `validation/implementation:issues` (the key the canonical
  ReadyToFinish gate reads); any issue forces `iterate`.
- **Finish**: upload the synthesized AssetPack(s) to Bitcode for review.

Implementation status vs this model (Gate-3 build-down): the deposit pipeline now
runs the canonical agents (mode propagated to the phases — F20), the measured
PATCH descriptor (F-series), Obfuscations + Setup input-comprehension, neediness
v0 (F24); inference is non-configurable (profiles removed — F26-A), the synthesis
runs decoupled via the harness (F26-B), and the PTRR envelope is unwrapped so real
output flows (F26-A/F27). The remaining Gate-3 measurement obligation is the formal
**absolutes** measurement category (see the roadmap below) — the catalog grounded
in `protocol-demonstration/`; the current source-coverage / demand-alignment /
reuse-likelihood are placeholders to be superseded.

Measurement formalization + the `measure-agent` hierarchy (Gates 3-5 roadmap;
Garrett, 2026-06-27):

- AssetPack measurements form TWO formal CATEGORIES (pluralized): **absolutes** and
  **needinesses**. Absolutes are intrinsic content measures — sizes (functions,
  types, etc.), a correctness estimate, and others drawn from the demonstration
  implementation (`protocol-demonstration/`). Needinesses are the read-demand / fit
  measures (the deposit-side neediness preview [F24 v0] + the read-side Need-fit;
  the BTD is the scalar over the needinesses). The legacy
  source-coverage / demand-alignment / reuse-likelihood placeholders are superseded
  by the formalized absolutes.
- The measurers are a base-class hierarchy of formal PTRR agents. In
  `generic-agents`: a base **measure-agent** (PTRR); from it two bases —
  **measure-agent-absolutes** and **measure-agent-needinesses**. In the asset-pack
  pipeline those base the two concrete measurers — **agent-measure-absolutes** and
  **agent-measure-needinesses** — each respecting the pipeline lens/mode
  (deposit | read) in Gate 4 (two lens-parameterized agents covering the four
  lens×category measurements).
- **Gate 3 (current)** formalizes the **absolutes** category (the non-needinesses):
  `measure-agent` + `measure-agent-absolutes` -> `agent-measure-absolutes`, with the
  absolutes catalog (sizes, correctness, …) grounded in `protocol-demonstration/`.
- **Gate 4 (read)** is lens FINALIZATIONS of the SAME SynthesizeAssetPacks pipeline
  (not a new pipeline — finalize the read lens) and MOSTLY the **needinesses**
  formalization: `measure-agent-needinesses` -> `agent-measure-needinesses`, beyond
  the F24 v0 preview. (Neediness v1 — the real embedding-vector supply-index probe +
  Read-Need/demand-corpus search — remains Gate 7.)
- **Gate 5** removes the lens/mode concept and splits SynthesizeAssetPacks into two
  pipelines — **SynthesizeAssetPacksForDepositor** and **SynthesizeAssetPacksForReader**
  — breaking the lens-configured implementations into per-role variants
  (`agent-measure-asset-packs-absolutes-for-depositor`,
  `agent-measure-asset-packs-needinesses-for-reader`, etc.).

### Gate-3 absolutes formalization — implementable contract (Garrett, 2026-06-27)

This is the implementable detail for the Gate-3 obligation above. Measurement is
made a FORMAL, SEPARATE step: an AssetPack is a *measured patch* = a patch
(synthesized by the Implementation agent) **measured by a dedicated measure-agent**.
Today the synthesis agent self-scores its own placeholder catalog inline; the
formalization moves absolute measurement out of synthesis into `agent-measure-absolutes`,
run in the **Validation** phase over each synthesized patch.

- **The absolutes catalog (v0).** Intrinsic, reader-independent measures of the
  synthesized patch. Each is grounded in the demonstration's static-measurement
  notion (`protocol-demonstration/`: `normalizedBitcodeVolume` / semantic volume,
  the static measurement report). The Gate-3 v0 catalog:
  - **sizes** — a set of structural magnitudes: `function-count`, `type-count`,
    `file-span` (the count of files the patch touches, deterministic from the patch
    descriptor's `fileChanges`). Each carries a raw `magnitude` (a count) AND a
    normalized 0..1 `volume`.
  - **correctness-estimate** — a 0..1 estimate of the synthesized knowledge's
    fidelity/buildability (the patch is internally coherent and faithful to the
    comprehension it was synthesized from).
  - **semantic-volume** — the demonstration analog (`normalizedBitcodeVolume`): a
    normalized 0..1 scalar of *how much* commercially-legible knowledge the pack
    encodes, a monotone function of the sizes. This is the absolute "amount" measure
    the BTD volume later grounds on.
- **Measurement shape.** `AssetPackCandidateMeasurement` gains `category:
  'absolute' | 'neediness'`, optional `magnitude` (raw count) and `unit`
  (`functions` | `types` | `files` | `estimate` | `normalized`). `volume` stays the
  normalized 0..1 the composite uses; `magnitude` is display/provenance only. The
  neediness preview (F24) is re-tagged `category:'neediness'`; the absolutes are
  `category:'absolute'`. The weighted composite is the weighted sum over the
  **absolutes'** `volume` (needinesses are never in the absolute composite).
- **The measure-agent factory hierarchy.** Realized as LAYERED FACTORIES (the
  codebase idiom — each "base" is a factory that configures the more general one,
  bottoming out in `factoryAgentWithPTRR`; there is no class inheritance):
  - `generic-agents/agents/measure-agent.ts` → **`factoryMeasureAgent`**: the base.
    Given `{ subject, measurements: MeasurementSpec[], category, name, description }`
    it builds a PTRR agent (identity = "you MEASURE an already-synthesized artifact;
    you do not synthesize or alter it; emit an honest measurement per spec with a
    source-safe rationale") whose output is
    `{ measurements: [{ measurementKind, magnitude?, volume, rationale }], summary }`.
  - `generic-agents/agents/measure-agent-absolutes.ts` →
    **`factoryMeasureAgentAbsolutes`**: calls `factoryMeasureAgent` with
    `category:'absolute'` and the absolutes framing ("absolutes are INTRINSIC — they
    depend only on the artifact itself, never on any reader, demand, or market").
    (The sibling `factoryMeasureAgentNeedinesses` is Gate 4.)
  - `pipelines/asset-pack/.../agent-measure-absolutes.ts` →
    **`agent-measure-absolutes`**: calls `factoryMeasureAgentAbsolutes` with the
    asset-pack absolutes catalog, lens-parameterized now (deposit | read) so Gate 4
    only finalizes the read lens — it does not restructure. Wrapper unwraps the PTRR
    envelope (F27) and stores to the execution.
- **Source-safety.** The measurer reasons over the source-safe patch DESCRIPTOR
  (`fileChanges` path+op, `patchSummary`) and Discovery comprehension — NEVER raw
  source. Size magnitudes are estimates/derivations, not AST reads of protected
  code. Telemetry withholds content as ever (`sourceSafeStreamEvent`).
- **Deterministic fallback.** When real inference is disabled
  (`isAssetPackRealInferenceEnabled() === false`), the absolutes are computed
  deterministically from the patch descriptor (`file-span` = `fileChanges` length;
  function/type counts estimated from covered-path and summary signal; correctness =
  confidence; semantic-volume = normalized size composite), preserving the
  source-safe, no-network test/preview path.

### Gate-3 depositing closure — tool-measured absolutes, decision-grade cards, config cleanup (Garrett, 2026-06-27)

Closes Gate-3 depositing: the absolutes are MEASURED by real static analysis (not
model guesses), the `/deposit` cards carry everything a technical knowledge-owner
needs for the deposit / no-deposit decision, and the superfluous pipeline config is
removed. All depositing agents/prompts/step-schemas must synthesize legitimately
informed AssetPacks, generically across repositories of all shapes and sizes.

- **Legitimate tool-based absolutes.** Sizes are MEASURED, not estimated by the model.
  A `SourceStaticAnalysisTool` (an `ExecutionTool`) parses the available source with
  language-generic regex fact-extraction inspired by the demonstration
  (`protocol-demonstration/src/bitcode-demo.js`: symbol / path / config-key
  extraction + per-unit token counts), producing measured counts — functions, types,
  symbols, config keys, lines, tokens — and per-language densities
  (functions/types per file). Individual analyses, composed together in the measurer.
- **Source reality.** The deposit-options run has NO full clone (the clone agent
  short-circuits when `repositoryFullName` is supplied), so the available source is
  the inventory SAMPLES (real, truncated source) + the path list. The tool therefore
  MEASURES density from the sampled source and applies it to the AP's EXACT covered
  file set: `file-span` exact; function/type counts = measured-density × covered-file
  count by language; `coverageRatio` reported for honesty. The SAME tool parses richer
  source verbatim when present (a future full-clone delivery path), so the measurement
  is generic across repo shapes/sizes and degrades honestly on sparse source.
- **Registry add/replace hierarchy (the primitive).** Tools register through
  `AgentToolsRegistry.registerTool(key, tool, priority)` — priority-keyed: same
  priority REPLACES, higher priority OVERRIDES; resolution is local-then-parent
  (children override parents). The base generic analyzer registers at priority 0;
  specialized / augmenting analyzers register at higher priority WITHOUT replacing the
  base. `agent-measure-absolutes` resolves the tool (local-then-parent) and runs it.
- **The measurer uses the tool.** `agent-measure-absolutes` now grounds on the
  static-analysis report: sizes come from the report (authoritative — the agent
  reports measured counts, it does not invent them); `correctness-estimate` and
  `semantic-volume` are the agent's grounded judgment over the report + the Discovery
  comprehension. The deterministic fallback computes ALL absolutes from the report.
- **Decision-grade AP cards.** Each `/deposit` card maximizes the deposit / no-deposit
  decision by showing what Bitcode RECEIVES if the AssetPack is deposited:
  1. the synthesized AP CONTENTS — the source-safe patch descriptor (`fileChanges`
     path+op + `patchSummary`): what knowledge/edits the AP encodes; and
  2. the PROVENANT SOURCE — the covered source files (`coveredSourcePaths`, raw paths)
     that become available to Bitcode for future reader settlement.
  Both surfaced prominently (not buried), framed as "if deposited, Bitcode receives."
  Shown to the DEPOSITOR, who owns the source — the source-safety law constrains
  leakage to readers/telemetry, NOT the owner reviewing their own repository. The
  candidate / option projection carries the patch descriptor + covered paths to the
  client (front+back synchronized).
- **Config cleanup.** The full SDIVF pipeline is the ONLY deposit synthesis path:
  remove `BITCODE_DEPOSIT_SYNTHESIS_PIPELINE`, the bounded-synthesis branch, and the
  zero-options bounded fallback in the deposit route; Setup → Discovery →
  Implementation → Validation → Finish always runs (Validation — measurement +
  quality — is never optional). Correct the route's dead `PROFILE=bounded` phrasing
  in the real-inference-required message (profiles were removed in F26-A).

### Gate-3 HOST architecture — the primitive Host, its kinds, in-host execution (Garrett, 2026-06-27)

The synthesis pipeline runs WITHIN a HOST — a real box with git, a filesystem, and
command exec. (Every host has these; there is no "git-less" host. The earlier
dev/prod, serverless-can't-clone, and read-files-out-per-file framings were WRONG and
are superseded by this section.)

The Host is a PRIMITIVE — `BitcodePipelineHost` (`packages/pipeline-hosts/host.ts`):
- `capabilities`: a HOST CAPABILITIES descriptor — `hostKind` (`'inline' | 'sandbox'`),
  `clone` + `filesystem` + `exec` (TRUE for every host), `ephemeralFilesystem`,
  `defaultWorkingDirectory`; a SandboxHost additionally carries `sandboxProvider`
  (`'vercel' | 'aws'`).
- `provisionRepository(source)` → checks out the FULL working tree at the revision
  (every blob, verbatim) into the host working directory → a `BitcodeHostWorkspace`:
  `listFiles()` (tracked source files), `readFile(path)` (verbatim content),
  `runCommand(...)`, `dispose()`.
Because the pipeline runs WITHIN the host, the workspace is the host's LOCAL checkout —
read locally, NEVER across a process/network boundary. The pipeline (Setup → … →
Validation) speaks only to the primitive, so its behavior is identical on every host.

**HostKinds — two implementations of the primitive:**
- **InlineHost** (`inline-host.ts`) — runs the pipeline in the current box; provisions
  via a real `git clone` of the full tree to a local working dir (Node-fs workspace).
- **SandboxHost** (`sandbox-host.ts`) — runs the pipeline inside a provisioned, isolated
  box that has git + FS, so within it the checkout is local exactly as for InlineHost.
  It is a base for providers:
  - **Vercel** (`VercelSandboxHost`, IMPLEMENTED) — provisions via the Sandbox SDK git
    source into the box working directory.
  - **AWS** (`AwsSandboxHost`, STUBBED) — the provider seam for an AWS-backed box; not
    yet implemented.
  Provisioning AND the pipeline both run IN the box; nothing is read out of it per-file.

**Selection** is by CONFIGURED HostKind — not by environment, and with no dev/prod /
local/remote terminology. `selectDepositHostKind(env)` returns `'inline' | 'sandbox'`
from `BITCODE_PIPELINE_HOST` (explicit), defaulting to `inline`; a SandboxHost's
provider comes from `BITCODE_SANDBOX_PROVIDER` (`'vercel' | 'aws'`, default `vercel`).
`resolveDepositPipelineHost()` constructs the configured HostKind/provider. The
operator chooses which host runs the pipeline.

**Source provisioning + measurement:** the harness run provisions the full checkout on
the configured host at run start (consistent with a box being created WITH its git
source — provisioning precedes the pipeline phases); the Setup clone agent then
confirms source-present. The inventory is built FROM the checkout:
`AssetPacksSynthesisSourceInventory` = `paths` (all tracked files) + `samples` (bounded
excerpts for the prompts) + `sources` (every tracked file's verbatim content, type
`AssetPacksSynthesisSourceFile {path, content}`, for measurement). `readWorkspaceSources(workspace, {paths?})`
bridges the checkout to `{path, content}[]`; `provisionDepositSourceInventory({host, …})`
(`uapi/lib/deposit-source-provisioning.ts`) orchestrates provision → read → dispose.
`applyExclusionsToInventory` filters `paths` + `samples` + `sources` fail-closed
(protected-IP paths are never measured, sampled, or carried). The GitHub-API sample
inventory (`buildSourceInventory`) is RETIRED; the `cloneRepository` metadata stub and
the Setup clone-agent short-circuit are superseded by the primitive's real provisioning.
Source-safety unchanged: the checkout lives ON the host; only source-safe measurements +
the source-safe patch/contents descriptors leave it. "Every blob, verbatim" = the full
WORKING TREE at the revision; `depth: 1` already yields it (full history `depth: 0` is a
separate, unneeded axis).

### Gate-3 implementation index — concrete artifacts (gate-closure completeness; Garrett, 2026-06-27)

The concrete artifacts implementing the Gate-3 spec above (so every G3 implementation
is named in spec for closure):

- **Measurement — absolutes.** `packages/agent-generics`: `factoryMeasureAgent` (base) +
  `factoryMeasureAgentAbsolutes`; `MeasureAgentOutputSchema` (reading
  `{measurementKind, magnitude?, volume, rationale}`). `packages/pipelines/asset-pack`:
  `factoryAssetPackMeasureAbsolutesAgent(lens)` → `agent-measure-absolutes`;
  `measureAssetPackAbsolutes(patch, {lens, execution, sources})` (sizes authoritative
  from the tool; correctness/semantic-volume the agent's grounded judgment;
  `computeAbsolutesFromReport` deterministic fallback; `mergeReportAndReadings`).
  `ASSET_PACK_ABSOLUTES_CATALOG` (function-count, type-count, file-span,
  correctness-estimate, semantic-volume; weights sum to 1).
  `AssetPackCandidateMeasurement {measurementKind, label, weight, volume, category, magnitude?, unit?}`.
- **Measurement — static analysis.** `SourceStaticAnalysisTool`
  (`agents/validation/source-static-analysis-tool.ts`): `analyzeStaticSource` /
  `analyzeStaticSourceFile` (language-generic regex by extension ts/js/py/rs/go/java/rb +
  generic fallback; functions/types/symbols/config-keys/lines/tokens; density applied to
  the covered set; `coverageRatio`). Registry: `registerSourceStaticAnalysisTool` /
  `resolveSourceStaticAnalysisTool` (priority add/replace, local-then-parent).
- **Validation wiring.** `runDepositValidationAgent` measures each pack via
  `measureAssetPackAbsolutes` (sources = `inventory.sources`), attaches `pack.absolutes`
  in place, re-stores `implementation:options`/`implementation:assetPacks`.
  `validateDepositSynthesisOptions` PREFERS `option.absolutes` (else the legacy catalog)
  and carries `candidate.patch`.
- **Neediness.** `computeNeediness(demand, saturation)` + `buildNeedinessFromSignal`
  (asset-packs-synthesis.ts); the Implementation `deposit-asset-pack-synthesis-agent`
  emits `needinessSignal`, grounded in the Discovery `deposit-depository-search-agent`
  (likelyReadTopics / demandAlignment / underservedTopics).
- **Decision-grade card.** `AssetPackPatchDescriptor {fileChanges:[{path,op}], patchSummary}`;
  `AssetPackCandidate.patch`; `DepositAssetPackOption.contents
  {patchSummary, fileChanges, provenantSourcePaths, provenantSourceCount}` + `roots.contentsRoot`,
  built by `buildRealDepositAssetPackOptionSynthesis`; the `/deposit` card renders the
  "If deposited, Bitcode receives" panel.
- **Host + provisioning.** `packages/pipeline-hosts`: `BitcodePipelineHost` /
  `BitcodeHostWorkspace` / `BitcodeHostCapabilities` (`host.ts`); `InlineHost`;
  `SandboxHost` + `VercelSandboxHost` (Vercel provider) + `AwsSandboxHost` (stub);
  `readWorkspaceSources`. `uapi/lib/deposit-source-provisioning.ts`:
  `selectDepositHostKind`, `resolveDepositPipelineHost`, `provisionDepositSourceInventory`.
- **Config.** `BITCODE_DEPOSIT_SYNTHESIS_PIPELINE` removed (full SDIVF pipeline only;
  Validation — measurement + quality — never skipped).

### Gate-3 #25 — SandboxHost in-box deposit dispatch (Garrett, 2026-06-27)

SandboxHost deposit runs the synthesis pipeline INSIDE the box (the asset-pack
harness already runs `assetPackPipeline` in-box for read-fit via a runner that imports
the live packages and executes the full SDIVF). Deposit reuses that mechanism:

- **Harness deposit mode.** `buildAssetPackSandboxHarness` accepts `synthesisMode`
  (`'deposit' | 'read'`) + the deposit STEERING (obfuscations, protected-IP exclusions,
  demand context); these flow into `PipelineHarnessManifest` and the in-box runner
  INPUT (`synthesizeMode`, steering). The in-box pipeline resolves deposit mode
  (`resolveSynthesizeAssetPacksMode` reads `input.synthesizeMode`) and runs the deposit
  SDIVF, reading the box's LOCAL checkout (the box was created WITH the git source, so
  the working tree is present — the clone agent confirms source-present). The runner
  surfaces the synthesized `implementation:options` in `evidence.json` as
  `depositOptions` (source-safe option metadata; the measure-agent's absolutes are
  already attached by the Validation phase IN the box).
- **Route dispatch.** When the configured HostKind is `sandbox`, the deposit route
  dispatches the deposit harness (a git `source` for the revision) via
  `VercelSandboxPipelineHost.runHarness` (provider Vercel) instead of the in-process
  InlineHost path; it reads `evidence.depositOptions`, runs the SAME pure projection
  (`validateDepositSynthesisOptions` + `buildRealDepositAssetPackOptionSynthesis`) and
  persists the deposit option synthesis to the execution row — identical to the inline
  path. Source-safe telemetry streams from the harness telemetry artifact to
  `execution_events`.
- **Parity of result.** InlineHost (in current box) and SandboxHost (in the provisioned
  box) produce the SAME deposit option synthesis; only WHERE the pipeline runs differs.
  Real-sandbox execution is verified against deployed sandbox infra (`@vercel/sandbox`,
  `VERCEL_*`, git in the box image); the harness plan-building + the route dispatch +
  the option projection are unit-tested with a mocked host.

**Open items for full gate-3 depositing closure:**
- **#25 — SandboxHost in-box deposit dispatch** (the one ❌): the deposit synthesis
  must RUN inside the sandbox box (the harness pattern, as the read-fit harness does),
  not provision-and-read-out. Specified here; not yet wired — `resolveDepositPipelineHost`
  rejects `sandbox` rather than fall back to a cross-boundary read. The InlineHost path
  is complete; the SandboxHost path needs the in-box pipeline dispatch.
- **Deployment config** (not code): the Vercel sandbox provider's runtime deps
  (`@vercel/sandbox`, `VERCEL_*`, git in the box image); the AWS provider (#20) beyond
  the stub.
- **Live verification**: a real deposit run on the InlineHost confirming measured sizes
  + the decision panel end-to-end.
