## Version executive summary

V38 is the inference-correctness version.
It follows V37 Website Conversations by returning to the agentic foundation beneath Reading, Conversations, tool prompts, telemetry, and depository search.
V38 must make Bitcode's inference call stack commercially exact: pipeline phases invoke PTRR agents; PTRR agents own Plan, Try, Refine, and Retry steps; each practical step uses `FailsafeGenerationSequence` for context preparation, large input handling, large output handling, and typed-output repair; each Failsafe chain delegates final Reason, Judge, and StructuredOutput inference to `ThricifiedGeneration`; provider calls happen only after all prompt registries, PromptParts, context bindings, tool documentation, and output schemas have composed into the final call envelope.

V38 also makes fit-finding commercially reliable.
`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` must derive search queries from inference, search the Bitcode Depository through lexical, symbolic, path, metadata, measurement, embedding/vector, and provider-specific channels, rank above-threshold candidate deposits, preserve their provenance, and hand selected fits to AssetPack synthesis without leaking unpaid source.
Existing OpenAI embedding policy (`text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dimensions, cosine `match_deliverable_vectors`) is the current source anchor; any LlamaIndex, Pinecone, or additional provider channel added during V38 must define storage, credentials, telemetry, tests, and source-safe boundaries before use.

## V38 inference stack law

V38 uses the existing primitive names precisely:

- `PipelineExecution` owns phase ordering, phase inputs, phase outputs, ancestry state, phase receipts, and pipeline telemetry.
- PTRR agents own `Plan`, `Try`, `Refine`, and `Retry` steps plus agent-level prompt registry composition.
- PTRR steps own their prompt registries, selected tools, Failsafe usage, typed step outputs, step receipts, and step telemetry.
- `FailsafeGenerationSequence` owns context preparation, large input handling, large output handling, stitch or summarization loops, and repair orchestration around the final typed inference chain.
- `ThricifiedGeneration` owns the lowest-level Reason, Judge, and StructuredOutput inference calls.
- `ToolExecution` owns callable tool input, execution, output, errors, and receipts.
- `DocCodeToolPrompt` and `formatUsableTools` own doc-comment-backed tool definitions that are injected into final prompts when tools are available to a step.

Tools are step-owned capabilities.
They are not hidden children of `ThricifiedGeneration`, but tool documentation must still be available to the final prompt material consumed by `ThricifiedGeneration`.
Every inference envelope must preserve template identity, prompt part identity, interpolated prompt, context bindings, selected tools, raw response, parsed typed result, schema verdict, retry or repair state, disclosure tier, proof root, and execution ancestry root at the permitted telemetry tier.

## V38 Reading pipeline focus

`ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` are the primary Reading pipelines under V38.
They must be audited from phase to agent to step to Failsafe substep to Thricified generation to tool to typed output.
The audit must count every inference point separately, name the prompts and PromptParts used by that point, define input context, define output schemas, define failure or repair behavior, and identify where the result is stored and streamed.

`ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` must synthesize an enterprise user's Read Request into a reviewable Need that says exactly what should be read, what must not be over-inferred, which repository/deposit constraints apply, and what measurements drive fit-finding.

`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` must discover many possible fits, not one fit.
It must gather above-threshold deposits from the Depository, rank and verify those candidates, preserve found-fit provenance, and hand the selected fits into AssetPack synthesis.
Before settlement, the Reader may see only source-safe measurements, fit reasons, quality posture, pricing posture, proof roots, and preview metadata.
After settlement, delivery may cross the visibility boundary and provide the full AssetPack source as governed by BTD rights transfer and ledger/database synchronization.

## V38 gate plan

### Gate 1: Inference Stack Roadmap And Spec Opening

Gate 1 opens V38 correctly:

- V38 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY files exist over active V37.
- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` remains `V37`.
- README, roadmap, PR template, package docs, demonstration docs, and workflows describe V37 active / V38 draft posture.
- `check:v38-gate1` validates branch naming, spec family, notes, parity, roadmap truth, workflow posture, inference vocabulary, depository-search vocabulary, and promotion boundaries.
- The V38 gate list is explicit before inference implementation begins.

### Gate 2: Inference Surface Inventory And Prompt Registry Map

Gate 2 inventories every active inference surface.
It must count Reading pipeline phases, PTRR agents, Plan/Try/Refine/Retry steps, Failsafe chains, ThricifiedGeneration calls, tool definitions, prompt templates, PromptParts, interpolation bindings, expected context fields, raw outputs, parsed typed outputs, failure surfaces, and storage/streaming destinations.
The inventory must cover `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis`, `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis`, Website Conversations, tool-definition prompts, and interface-specific inference entrypoints.
Gate 2 is closed by the package-backed `V38InferenceSurfaceInventory` source and the deterministic `.bitcode/v38-inference-surface-inventory.json` artifact.
The artifact has `source-safe-inference-surface-metadata` disclosure posture and records 7 inventory rows, 13 phase or surface groups, 13 PTRR agents, 52 PTRR steps, 156 Failsafe/Thricified chains, 468 provider-call slots, and 9 tool or tool-definition surfaces without serializing protected prompts, protected source, credentials, raw provider payloads, or unpaid AssetPack source.

### Gate 3: PTRR Failsafe And Thricified Execution Stack

Gate 3 makes practical PTRR steps use `FailsafeGenerationSequence` above `ThricifiedGeneration` unless a source-backed exception is specified and tested.
It must validate prompt registry composition from phase to agent to step to Failsafe to Thricified generation and provider call, including execution ancestry state preparation and typed-output repair.
Gate 3 is closed by the package-backed `V38PtrrFailsafeThricifiedStack` source and deterministic `.bitcode/v38-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.json` artifact.
The artifact has `source-safe-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack-metadata` disclosure posture and proves the current practical call stack with 9 source-backed rows, 69 passed source predicates, all 4 PTRR steps, all 3 Failsafe stages, all 3 ThricifiedGeneration stages, and Gate 2's 52 PTRR steps / 156 Failsafe sequences / 156 ThricifiedGeneration chains / 468 provider-call slots.
Gate 3 confirms tools remain step-owned postprocess capabilities while `FailsafeGenerationSequence` delegates final Reason, Judge, and StructuredOutput production to `ThricifiedGeneration`.

### Gate 4: PromptPart And Prompt Benchmarking

Gate 4 completes prompt and PromptPart benchmarking.
Prompt benchmarking is the source-safe measurement contract for complete Prompt registries and their composed PromptParts.
Semantically divided PromptParts and complete Prompts must be benchmarkable with initial benchmark suites for active Reading, Conversation, and tool-definition inference surfaces.
Benchmarks must preserve prompt identity, fixture inputs, expected typed-output qualities, disclosure tiers, and stable report artifacts.
Gate 4 is closed by the package-backed `V38PromptBenchmarkReport` source and deterministic `.bitcode/v38-prompt-benchmark-report.json` artifact.
The artifact has `source-safe-prompt-benchmark-metadata` disclosure posture and records 7 benchmark rows, 13 source-safe fixtures, 24 typed-output quality expectations, 38 passed source predicates, 443 active PromptPart doc-comments, 39 complete Prompt doc-comments, 465 benchmark definitions, 275 PromptPart exports, and 85 Prompt constructions across Reading, Conversation, and tool-definition inference surfaces without serializing raw prompt text, protected source, credentials, raw provider responses, or unpaid AssetPack source.

### Gate 5: Inference Telemetry And Disclosure Tiers

Gate 5 binds inference execution to source-safe telemetry.
It must stream phase, agent, step, Failsafe, ThricifiedGeneration, tool, prompt-template, interpolated-prompt, raw-response, parsed-output, schema-verdict, retry, repair, and failure evidence at the correct disclosure tier without leaking protected source, credentials, unpaid AssetPack contents, wallet private material, or settlement private payloads.
Gate 5 is closed by the package-backed `V38InferenceTelemetryDisclosureReport` source and deterministic `.bitcode/v38-disclosure-boundary-report.json` artifact.
The artifact has `source-safe-inference-telemetry-disclosure-metadata` disclosure posture and records 8 telemetry/disclosure rows, 13 required telemetry levels, 12 disclosure tier ids, 66 passed source predicates, and upstream proof roots for V35 telemetry taxonomy, V37 stream events, V38 inference inventory, V38 PTRR/Failsafe/Thricified stack, and V38 prompt benchmarking.
The raw provider response boundary is private or root-only: public and reader-visible streams may show raw-response presence, roots, typed output shape, schema verdicts, retry/repair posture, and prompt/template identities, but never raw provider response content, raw protected prompt text, protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, wallet private material, or private settlement payloads.

### Gate 6: ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis Inference Hardening

Gate 6 hardens Read Request to Need synthesis.
It must implement PTRR/Failsafe/Thricified parity for the pipeline, store reviewable Need outputs, support resynthesis with feedback, define Need measurements, and prove that the Need is neither under-specified nor over-broad relative to the Read Request.
Gate 6 is closed by the package-backed `V38ReadNeedComprehensionInferenceHardening` source, deterministic `.bitcode/v38-read-need-comprehension-inference-hardening.json` artifact, ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis inference receipt, and package tests.
The artifact has `source-safe-read-need-comprehension-inference-hardening-metadata` disclosure posture and records 5 lifecycle/receipt rows, 4 phases, 4 PTRR agents, 16 PTRR steps, 48 Failsafe sequences, 48 ThricifiedGeneration chains, 144 provider-call slots, and 22 passed source predicates.
The produced `ReadNeed` now carries a source-safe inference receipt binding phase ids, agent ids, PTRR step ids, Failsafe sequence ids, ThricifiedGeneration ids, prompt template ids, interpolation keys, output schema ids, telemetry ids, and roots without exposing protected source, raw provider response content, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, wallet private material, or private settlement data.

### Gate 7: ReadFitsFindingSynthesis Depository Search And Embeddings

Gate 7 hardens Finding Fits.
It must use inference-derived search queries, depository-search tools, vector embeddings, metadata and measurement channels, lexical and symbolic channels, ranking, verification, thresholding, and selected-fit provenance.
It must maintain the active `text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dimension, cosine `match_deliverable_vectors` policy unless a replacement is specified, tested, and migrated.
Gate 7 is closed by the package-backed `V38ReadFitsFindingSearchEmbeddings` source, deterministic `.bitcode/v38-read-fits-finding-search-embeddings.json` artifact, `ReadFitsFindingSynthesisSearchReceipt`, and package tests.
The artifact has `source-safe-read-fits-finding-search-embeddings-metadata` disclosure posture and records 7 lifecycle/search rows, 7 phases, 8 PTRR agents, 32 PTRR steps, 96 Failsafe sequences, 96 ThricifiedGeneration chains, 288 provider-call slots, 4 tool contracts, 7 search channels, 12 default above-threshold selected-candidate carryforward slots, and 23 passed source predicates.
`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` now emits source-safe query-plan and search receipts binding lexical, symbolic, path, metadata, measurement, embedding-vector, and provider-specific channels to query roots, ranking roots, selected-fit provenance roots, threshold posture, candidate counts, and the active OpenAI embedding/vector-store policy without exposing protected source, raw provider responses, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, wallet private material, or private settlement data.

### Gate 8: AssetPack Synthesis Handoff And Economic Traceability

Gate 8 verifies found fits flow into AssetPack synthesis and settlement posture.
Selected fit deposits must remain traceable into source-safe preview, post-settlement delivery, contributor compensation, exact ledger/database synchronization, proof receipts, and repair paths.
Gate 8 is closed by the package-backed `V38AssetPackSynthesisEconomicTraceability` source, deterministic `.bitcode/v38-assetpack-synthesis-economic-traceability.json` artifact, AssetPack source-safe preview tests, BTD receipt/source-to-shares/reconciliation tests, and pipeline harness tests.
The artifact has `source-safe-assetpack-synthesis-economic-traceability-metadata` disclosure posture and records 9 handoff/economic rows, 18 required receipt fields, selected-fit handoff, source-safe preview before settlement, protected-source leak scanning, deterministic share-to-fee BTC quote, BTD mint/read/rights receipts, contributor compensation, settlement unlock, post-settlement delivery boundary, ledger/database synchronization, proof receipts, repair paths, source-to-shares conservation, and harness evidence projection without exposing protected source, raw provider response content, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, wallet private material, or private settlement payloads.

### Gate 9: Conversation And Tool-Prompt Inference Parity

Gate 9 brings Website Conversations, tool-definition prompts, and interface-specific inference entrypoints to the same registry, Failsafe, Thricified, tool prompt, telemetry, and disclosure posture as Reading.
Conversation inference must reuse the inference primitives without becoming a parallel Protocol authority.
Gate 9 is closed by the package-backed `V38ConversationToolPromptInferenceParity` source, deterministic `.bitcode/v38-conversation-tool-prompt-inference-parity.json` artifact, Conversation stream/telemetry tests, Terminal execution-log rendering test, ChatGPT App tool prompt/admission tests, generator, checker, and workflow wiring.
The artifact has `source-safe-conversation-tool-prompt-inference-parity-metadata` disclosure posture and records 8 parity rows, 34 source predicates, PTRR coverage for comprehensive and quick-response Conversation variations, prompt registry and step prompt coverage, typed output schemas, source-safe stream telemetry, rich execution-log UI projection, DocCodeToolPrompt formatting, ToolPromptRegistry hierarchy, ChatGPT App doc-code prompt carriers, and interface entrypoint no-bypass posture without exposing protected source, raw prompt text, raw provider response content, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, or global ledger authority.

### Gate 10: Local Staging Inference And Depository Search Rehearsal

Gate 10 proves the V38 inference stack locally and in staging-testnet.
It must rehearse ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis, ReadFitsFindingSynthesis, depository search, AssetPack preview, source-safe telemetry, and blocked value-bearing mainnet posture with real non-mocked inference where credentials are available.

### Gate 11: V38 Promotion Readiness

Gate 11 closes V38 with promotion readiness.
It must generate V38 proof support, validate every V38 artifact, update promotion workflows, preserve V37 active / V38 draft to V38 active / V39 draft posture, and block promotion if inference, prompt benchmarking, search, telemetry, source-safety, or settlement traceability evidence is incomplete.

## V38 non-goals

- V38 does not change BTD supply law, Bitcoin settlement law, Exchange law, or production-mainnet admission unless a later promoted canon explicitly does so.
- V38 does not introduce versioned routes, versioned API paths, or versioned source identifiers.
- V38 does not allow protected source, raw protected prompts, raw provider responses, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, private wallet material, or private settlement payloads to appear in public telemetry.
- V38 does not replace the existing prompt, registry, execution, agent, tool, and pipeline primitives with a parallel abstraction stack.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode is the commercial Protocol implementation for depositing, measuring, finding, synthesizing, settling, delivering, and proving technical intelligence as BTD and AssetPack activity.
V38 does not replace V37 canon; it deepens the inference machinery that lets Bitcode understand Read Requests, synthesize Needs, find many fits across the Depository, synthesize source-safe AssetPack previews, and deliver full AssetPacks only after settlement and rights transfer.

## source-of-truth hierarchy

The source-of-truth hierarchy for V38 is:

1. `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to active V37 until V38 promotion.
2. `BITCODE_SPEC_V37.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V37_PROVEN.md` remain active canon.
3. `BITCODE_SPEC_V38.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_PARITY_MATRIX.md` are the draft target family during V38 gates.
4. Package source, tests, scripts, workflows, generated `.bitcode/*` artifacts, local/staging rehearsal evidence, and promotion checks must converge before V38 promotion.

## full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V38 work must preserve full-system auditability.
No implementation may bypass package-owned primitives for executions, pipelines, PTRR agents, prompt registries, tools, telemetry, BTD, ledger/database synchronization, object storage, or source-safe disclosure.
Any re-implementation must prove parity against the active primitive and may not fork an easier parallel path.

## totality and precision enforcement rule

V38 gates must make every inference edge total enough to audit: inputs, prompts, PromptParts, interpolation bindings, tools, outputs, raw provider responses, parsed typed results, schema verdicts, repairs, failures, storage destinations, streaming destinations, proof roots, and disclosure tiers must be precise before promotion.

## system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals: commercial inference correctness, reliable Reading intelligence, benchmarkable prompt materials, source-safe telemetry, depository-wide fit-finding, and settlement-traceable AssetPack synthesis.
Non-goals: value-bearing mainnet admission, BTD supply changes, bridge chain-of-record implementation, versioned routes, or provider-specific shortcuts without tests.
Design principles: reuse primitives, preserve typed receipts, fail closed, expose only permitted disclosure tiers, and make every prompt and search decision auditable.

## system architecture and layer boundaries

The V38 architecture boundary is `PipelineExecution -> PTRR agent -> PTRR step -> FailsafeGenerationSequence -> ThricifiedGeneration -> provider call`.
`ToolExecution` remains step-owned.
Prompt registry and PromptPart composition must flow downward from phase, agent, step, Failsafe, tool documentation, and generation prompt materials into the final provider call.
Ledger, wallet, object storage, GitHub delivery, and settlement operations remain outside inference authority and are invoked only through their existing package or route boundaries.

## canonical domain model

The V38 domain model carries the existing Bitcode objects: deposits, Reads, Read Requests, Needs, candidate fit deposits, AssetPacks, BTD ranges, preview measurements, settlement receipts, delivery receipts, proof roots, execution receipts, prompt receipts, tool receipts, telemetry events, and repair cases.
V38 adds no new chain-of-record object; it makes inference and fit-finding receipts precise enough to support the existing Protocol model.

## whole Bitcode operator chain

The whole operator chain is deposit source, measure deposited material, request a Read, synthesize a Need, review or resynthesize the Need, find many fitting deposits, synthesize a source-safe AssetPack preview, calculate deterministic settlement posture, settle in BTC when admitted, transfer BTD read rights, deliver the full AssetPack, journal database/ledger/object-storage projections, emit telemetry, and preserve proof roots for repair.

## generated canon

Generated canon for V38 includes source-safe `.bitcode/v38-*` artifacts, generated reports, benchmark reports, rehearsal evidence, and the eventual `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_PROVEN.md`.
Generated artifacts must be reproducible, deterministic where possible, and blocked when source-safe payload rules fail.
Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts remain the baseline for deterministic generated proof.
Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts remain the baseline for operator-visible quality.
Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix includes `.bitcode/v38-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-inference-surface-inventory.json`, `.bitcode/v38-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.json`, `.bitcode/v38-prompt-benchmark-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-disclosure-boundary-report.json`, and later `.bitcode/v38-*` gate artifacts.
V38 specifying generated artifacts include inference inventory, prompt benchmark, telemetry disclosure, depository search, AssetPack handoff, rehearsal, and promotion readiness reports.
Shared generated-artifact fields: version, currentTarget, artifactRoot, sourceRoots, proofRoots, disclosureTier, generatedAt, and command.
Artifact-specific generated payload fields: prompt ids, PromptPart ids, phase ids, agent ids, step ids, Failsafe ids, ThricifiedGeneration ids, tool ids, fit ids, ranking roots, and settlement roots.
Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy: public, source-safe, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, operator-only, and forbidden.

## validation canon

Validation canon includes `pnpm run check:v38-gate1`, `pnpm run check:v38-gate2`, `pnpm run check:v38-gate3`, `pnpm run check:v38-gate4`, `pnpm run check:v38-gate5`, later V38 gate checks, `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V38 --mode draft --current-target V37`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V37`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V37 --draft-target V38`, package tests, route tests, UI tests, prompt benchmark checks, telemetry redaction checks, and local/staging rehearsal checks.

## promotion canon

Promotion canon requires all V38 gates to close, V38 proof support to exist, a V38 promotion workflow to pass, and the promotion commit to change only accepted canon artifacts and the `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer from V37 to V38.

## appendices and canonical supporting material

The appendices below are canonical supporting material for V38 gate work.

## Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Canonical types include `PipelineExecution`, PTRR agent config, Plan/Try/Refine/Retry step receipts, Failsafe receipts, ThricifiedGeneration receipts, ToolExecution receipts, PromptPart, Prompt, prompt template, interpolation binding, Need, fit candidate, selected fit, AssetPack preview, settlement receipt, and telemetry event.

## Appendix B. Proof family closure catalog

The proof family closure catalog is the nine proof-family canon above.
Each family must close with proofArtifactPath, members, theoremIds, replayStepIds, witnessArtifactPaths, current member closure criteria, current member verdict shape, current theorem-by-theorem closure reading, current theorem-to-replay grouping, minimum artifact/replay binding set, current proof-object fields, generated-artifact and test bindings, and fail-closed conditions.

### V38InferenceSurfaceInventory

`V38InferenceSurfaceInventory` is the Gate 2 source-safe inference surface inventory.
It is owned by `packages/protocol/src/canonical/inference-surface-inventory.js`, exported by `packages/protocol/src/index.js`, type-declared by `packages/protocol/src/index.d.ts`, tested by `packages/protocol/test/v38-inference-surface-inventory.test.js`, generated by `scripts/generate-v38-inference-surface-inventory.mjs`, checked by `scripts/check-v38-gate2-inference-surface-inventory.mjs`, and serialized to `.bitcode/v38-inference-surface-inventory.json`.

Its current count contract is 52 PTRR steps across 156 FailsafeGenerationSequence / ThricifiedGeneration chains and 468 provider-call slots. Gate 9 removes the quick-response Conversation single-step repair marker by routing that variation through the same PTRR/Failsafe/Thricified stack while preserving the inventory row as source-safe metadata.

### V38PtrrFailsafeThricifiedStack

`V38PtrrFailsafeThricifiedStack` is the Gate 3 source-safe stack contract for practical PTRR agents.
It is owned by `packages/protocol/src/canonical/ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.js`, exported by `packages/protocol/src/index.js`, type-declared by `packages/protocol/src/index.d.ts`, tested by `packages/protocol/test/v38-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.test.js`, generated by `scripts/generate-v38-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.mjs`, checked by `scripts/check-v38-gate3-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.mjs`, and serialized to `.bitcode/v38-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.json`.

It records `source-safe-conversation-tool-prompt-inference-parity-metadata`: comprehensive and quick-response Conversation PTRR variations, Conversation agent and step prompt registries, typed output schemas, stream events, telemetry proof hooks, execution-log rendering, DocCodeToolPrompt formatting, ToolPromptRegistry hierarchy, ChatGPT App doc-code prompt carriers, read-access and organization-authority checks, and interface entrypoint no-bypass posture.
Its current source-predicate contract is 34/34 passed predicates, 8 rows, upstream roots from V38 Gates 2, 4, and 5, and no protected source, raw prompt text, raw provider response content, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, global ledger authority claim, or `_legacy/` source roots.

### V38InferenceTelemetryDisclosureReport

`V38InferenceTelemetryDisclosureReport` is the Gate 5 source-safe inference telemetry and disclosure tier contract.
It is generated to `.bitcode/v38-disclosure-boundary-report.json` as `source-safe-inference-telemetry-disclosure-metadata`.
It binds phase, agent, PTRR step, Failsafe, ThricifiedGeneration, tool, prompt template, interpolated prompt, raw response, parsed output, schema verdict, retry, repair, and stream UI projection rows to allowed payload fields, forbidden payload classes, proof roots, storage targets, stream event kinds, fail-closed states, and source predicates.
Its current count contract is 8 rows, 13 required telemetry levels, 12 disclosure tier ids, 66 passed predicates, no legacy source roots, and no public raw provider response, protected source, credential, wallet private material, private settlement payload, or unpaid AssetPack source visibility.

### V38ReadNeedComprehensionInferenceHardening

It records `source-safe-read-need-comprehension-inference-hardening-metadata`: request normalization, Need comprehension, Need measurement, Need review, source-safe inference receipt fields, route/UI resynthesis support, accepted-Need admission boundary, and upstream roots from V38 Gates 2 through 5.
Its current source-predicate contract is 22/22 passed predicates, 5 rows, 4 phases, 4 PTRR agents, 16 PTRR steps, 48 Failsafe sequences, 48 ThricifiedGeneration chains, 144 provider-call slots, and no protected source, raw provider response content, credentials, unpaid AssetPack source, private wallet material, private settlement payload, or `_legacy/` source roots.

Shared generated-artifact fields: version, currentTarget, artifactRoot, sourceRoots, proofRoots, disclosureTier, generatedAt, and command.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Artifact-specific generated payload fields: prompt ids, PromptPart ids, phase ids, agent ids, step ids, Failsafe ids, ThricifiedGeneration ids, tool ids, fit ids, ranking roots, and settlement roots.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy: public, source-safe, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, operator-only, and forbidden.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The generated appendix must include aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when generated proof evidence is stale, missing, or unsafe.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture require V38 scripts to regenerate artifacts deterministically and fail closed on missing source roots, missing prompt ids, missing schema verdicts, unsafe telemetry payloads, stale proof-source commit, or mismatched canonical pointer.

## Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

V38 validation begins with `check:v38-gate1` and expands through Gate 11.
Gate checks must be scriptable, workflow-wired, source-safe, and specific enough to identify the missing source or artifact.

## Appendix E. Current canonical source map

Current source map roots include `packages/agent-generics`, `packages/prompts`, `packages/tools-generics`, `packages/pipelines/asset-pack`, `packages/protocol`, `packages/api`, `uapi`, `.github/workflows`, `scripts`, and `protocol-demonstration` as a standalone minimal witness.

## Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

Subsystem totality coverage includes repo supply and depositing, reading and measured demand, prompt/inference/evaluator ownership, deposit-to-read fit, recall and ranking, verification decisions, selection and materialization, branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence, identity, authority, signing, and policy, sensitive data and confidentiality flows, projection, disclosure, and redaction, proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay, settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting, telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics, host/runtime capability truth, operator experience and pedagogy, validation and test stack, generated artifacts and canonical promotion.

## Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

The V38 file family is `BITCODE_SPEC_V38.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and eventually `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_PROVEN.md`.
Promotion may update `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` only after all gates close and promotion validation succeeds.

## Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces include Terminal, Conversations, API, MCP API, ChatGPT App, Auxillaries, Exchange, generated proof reports, dashboards, runbooks, and local/staging rehearsal surfaces.
V38 operator quality requires collapsed readable state and expanded source-safe detail for inference telemetry.

Scenario and workflow coverage includes auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch, context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, and Valuable workflows.

## Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

Fail-closed conditions include invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, and stale promoted status truth.

V38 may expose only source-safe preview metadata before settlement.

## accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

Accepted boundaries: V38 can harden inference, prompt benchmarking, search, telemetry, and traceability; V38 cannot change BTD supply law, route versioning discipline, mainnet admission, or settlement finality law without explicit later promotion.
Reopen conditions: evidence of prompt leakage, inference bypassing primitives, untraceable fit selection, unsafe telemetry, broken depository search, or stale generated proof.

## completion condition

V38 is complete only when every V38 gate is implemented, specified, tested, documented, generated, workflow-wired, source-safe, locally/staging rehearsed where applicable, and promotion-ready with `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_PROVEN.md` support.
