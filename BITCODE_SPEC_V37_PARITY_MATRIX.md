# Bitcode Spec V37 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V37`
- V37 state: draft implementation; V37 parity includes Website Conversations spec family, roadmap, docs, workflow, checker posture, Gate 2 ConversationSession route-history contracts, Gate 3 ConversationStreamEvent stream UI/event contracts, Gate 4 ConversationWritingWorkspace fullscreen composer contracts, Gate 5 ConversationSourceSelector context policy contracts, and Gate 6 ConversationTerminalHandoff transaction handoff contracts
- Current canonical/latest target: `V36`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: draft `.bitcode/v37-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v37-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v37-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, `.bitcode/v37-conversation-session-route-history.json`, `.bitcode/v37-conversation-stream-event-contract.json`, `.bitcode/v37-conversation-writing-workspace.json`, `.bitcode/v37-conversation-source-selector.json`, and `.bitcode/v37-conversation-terminal-handoff.json`
- Source parity state: V37 source parity begins at Gate 1 with spec family, roadmap, docs, workflow, and checker posture; Gate 2 adds package-owned ConversationSession route-history contracts; Gate 3 adds package-owned ConversationStreamEvent contracts and stream UI binding; Gate 4 adds package-owned ConversationWritingWorkspace fullscreen composer contracts; Gate 5 adds package-owned ConversationSourceSelector context policy; Gate 6 adds package-owned ConversationTerminalHandoff transaction handoff contracts
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V37.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V37_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V37_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V37_PROVEN.md` only after V37 promotion
- Scope: V37 draft parity ledger for Website Conversations over promoted V36 Exchange canon
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V36`

## Purpose

The V37 parity matrix prevents Website Conversations from becoming UI-only chat folklore, local-only state, or a parallel product law.
Every V37 gate must name package-owned conversation objects, source-safe payloads, route-local persistence rules, proof roots, generated artifacts, validation commands, disclosure boundaries, telemetry/runbook bindings, Terminal handoff boundaries, and fail-closed repair posture.

## V37 accepted boundaries

- V37 owns Website Conversations.
- V37 inherits promoted V36 Exchange law and must not reopen Exchange ownership, pricing, settlement, rights-transfer, or disclosure rules.
- V37 does not authorize value-bearing production-mainnet launch.
- V37 does not expose protected AssetPack source before settlement through any runtime carrier, generated proof, log, interface, stream, source selector, or handoff.
- V37 does not redefine BTD supply, BTC fee separation, AssetPack range identity, owner-read/licensed-read law, measureminting, ancestry, or Reading pipeline product law.
- V37 does not replace the V28 ChatGPT App or V33 interface contract canon.

## V37 completion condition

V37 parity is complete when each Conversations gate row has source evidence, tests, generated artifacts where required, workflow/checker support, documentation, local/staging rehearsal evidence, and closed parity judgment, and when V37 promotion can rewrite `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` from `V36` to `V37` only after promotion-grade validations pass.
