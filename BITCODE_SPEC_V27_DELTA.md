# Bitcode Spec V27 Delta

## Status

- Version: `V27`
- State: promoted canonical delta
- Active canonical pointer: `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` -> `V27`
- Scope: tokenomics and practical crypto-application delta from V26 commercial Bitcode baseline to V27 formal `$BTD` tokenomics and cryptotechnological commercialization
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V27.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V27_NOTES.md`
- Parity companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V27_PARITY_MATRIX.md`
- Generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V27_PROVEN.md`

This DELTA records what V27 changes relative to V26.
It is the promoted V27 planning, implementation, and closure ledger after generated proof closure.

## Why V27 Exists

V26 commercialized Bitcode as a minimum viable commercial system and deliberately deferred deep tokenomics plus the practical crypto-application surfaces needed to operate `$BTD` as a real ledger-aware commercial asset.

V26 established:

- BTC is the fee asset;
- `$BTD` is non-fungible AssetPack share/read-right posture plus measured Bitcode amount;
- generic `$BTD` balance mutation is closed;
- Terminal Need minting is future V27 work;
- Exchange existing-`$BTD` purchase was staged for V28 before V27's practical crypto scope was expanded;
- `packages/btd` contains the 21,000,000 mintable ceiling as a staged invariant.

V27 exists to make that deferred `$BTD` model exact and to close the minimum wallet, BTC fee, ledgerized AssetPack, minimal Exchange, Terminal transaction, reconciliation, testnet, mainnet-readiness, telemetry, and upgrade path.

The WDRR sharpens V27's draft direction:

- normalized Bitcode volume is proof-addressable semantic volume, not byte count or tokenizer count;
- primary issuance law is fixed-supply measureminting decay, with refit-only demoted to tail behavior;
- zero-cell receipts are valid V27 receipts when decayed entitlement falls below one whole cell;
- BTC fee transactions use PSBT-style user signing and do not place user private keys under Bitcode server custody;
- regtest or equivalent local chain is the deterministic local proof lane;
- signet is the canonical public Bitcoin proof lane;
- public Bitcoin testnet is supplementary rather than canonical proof infrastructure;
- Ethereum anchoring is secondary or optional in V27 and must not redefine `$BTD` issuance law;
- ancestry is optional but canonical, evidence-bound, and non-supply;
- local Exchange settlement and licensed reads own recurring economics, not third-party royalty signaling.

## Delta Contract

V27 changes Bitcode by turning `$BTD` from V26's proved commercial posture into complete tokenomics law and a practical cryptotechnological implementation baseline.

The delta is not a marketing token launch.
The delta is a protocol, package, receipt, database, proof, UI, and parity formalization.

V27 must make all of these implementation-derivable:

- finite global mintable supply;
- non-fungible cell identity;
- AssetPack contiguous range ownership;
- Need-Fit-Prove-Settle mint admission;
- proof-addressable semantic volume quantization;
- deterministic allocation;
- owner-read vs licensed-read;
- revenue routing;
- optional proof-backed ancestry;
- anti-game and dispute posture;
- fixed-supply measureminting decay;
- zero-cell/refit tail behavior.
- wallet authorization and signing posture;
- actual BTC fee transaction receipts;
- PSBT-style signing handoff without server custody of user private keys;
- ledgerized AssetPack anchors;
- minimal buy, sell, bid, ask, cancellation, settlement, and rights-transfer flow;
- Terminal transaction journals;
- ledgerized journal diffing;
- ledger/database reconciliation;
- testnet and mainnet-ready deployment lanes;
- regtest and signet as the required Bitcoin proof lanes;
- crypto telemetry, alerting, and upgrade receipts.

## From V26 To V27

| V26 source truth | V27 delta |
| --- | --- |
| `$BTD` is non-fungible AssetPack share/read-right posture | `$BTD` becomes exact cell/range registry law |
| `BTD_MAX_MINTABLE_SUPPLY = 21_000_000` exists in package | cap becomes package, receipt, DB, proof, and UI invariant |
| generic balance mutation fails closed | fungible mutation rejection becomes total V27 law |
| `user_credits` stores aggregate holdings as compatibility carrier | new Exchange BTD registry schema is specified and implemented |
| Terminal minting is future V27 intent | Need-Fit-Prove-Settle mint admission becomes canonical |
| Exchange purchase was V28 intent | V27 now owns minimal existing-`$BTD` acquisition, bid/ask, and rights-transfer closure; V28+ owns broader market depth |
| AssetPack evidence and Shippables are distinct | minted AssetPack ranges bind to stored AssetPack evidence and access policy |
| source-to-shares proof exists | proof artifacts gain minted range and supply/replay roots |
| licensed private reads exist in demonstration receipts | licensed-read policy and revenue routing become V27 tokenomics |
| ancestry is not a V26 requirement | ancestry becomes optional canonical non-supply module for knowledge-economy routing |
| wallet posture is UI/readiness-level | wallet integration becomes signer/session/network/receipt infrastructure |
| BTC fee asset is specified | BTC fees become actual transaction receipts bound to Terminal and Exchange journals |
| AssetPacks are proof/store objects | AssetPacks gain ledger anchors for range, source root, proof root, and policy hash |
| database carries commercial state | database becomes ledger-derived plus metaphysical canonical projection with reconciliation |
| testnet/mainnet are future operational paths | V27 specifies testnet implementation and mainnet-ready controls without automatic value-bearing launch |

- pending, confirmed, reorged, and failed states replay.

Closure evidence:

- `packages/btd/src/ledger-anchor.ts` owns `AssetPackLedgerAnchor` and selects `taproot` by default for Bitcoin anchors.

- `btd_exchange_orders` and `btd_rights_transfer_receipts` persist range, parties, BTC price, access policy hash, order state, Exchange sequence, receipt projection, and non-empty ledger-anchor evidence.
- package, API, ORM, and demonstration tests prove all order kinds, cancel/accept/settle, rights transfer, JSON-safe route projection, explicit commit behavior, and failure without settled order or ledger anchor.

### Gate 13: Terminal Transaction And Journal Diff Closure

Purpose:
Make Terminal actions accountable from user intent through Exchange settlement and ledger observation.

Status:
Closed for draft-target implementation by `.bitcode/v27-gate-13-terminal-journal-proof.json`.

Closure criteria:

- Terminal transaction families cover Need, Fit, proof, mint, fee, anchor, license, order, transfer, dispute, and settlement finalization.
- journal entries carry stable ids, pre-state roots, post-state roots, receipt roots, and ledger anchor references.

### Gate 14: Ledger/Database Reconciliation Closure

Purpose:
Make ledgers the source of truth for cryptographic finality while preserving Bitcode's canonical private/metaphysical database facts.

Status:
Closed for draft-target implementation by `.bitcode/v27-gate-14-ledger-database-reconciliation-proof.json`.

- database projections cannot override confirmed ledger facts.
- private source metadata, proof bundles, access policies, disputes, telemetry, and pending state are explicitly non-ledgerized canonical facts.
- reconciler emits repair and alert receipts.
- idempotent replay is tested.

Closure evidence:

- `packages/btd/src/reconciliation.ts` compares ledger-observed facts and database projections, emits deterministic repair receipts, and makes confirmed, reorged, or failed finality mismatches blocking.

- `packages/btd/src/upgrade.ts` emits planned/applied/verified/rolled-back/failed upgrade receipts with migration roots, state roots, approvals, rollback roots, and ledger anchor ids.
- `/api/btd/deployment-readiness` is the unversioned commercial route for readiness checks, telemetry events, and upgrade receipt plan/transition persistence.
- package, API, ORM, and demonstration tests prove signet readiness, missing-env blocking, critical/warning telemetry classification, upgrade planning, and mainnet value-bearing approval rejection.

### Gate 16: Research Rebinding And Promotion Closure

- `uapi/app/btd/[assetPackId]/page.tsx` provides an unversioned range/policy/read-right disclosure route;
- the former version-prefixed UAPI protocol corridors are ported to unversioned `/api/external-realization` and `/api/executors/[interfaceId]`;
- `internal-docs/BITCODE_V27_CRYPTO_RESEARCH_REBINDING.md` binds Bitcoin, BIP 174, BIP 341, Filecoin, EIPs, and adapter-library research to V27 implementation choices;

- V26 specification and proof surfaces mention wallet readiness, testnet/mainnet posture, telemetry, reconciliation, and ledger-facing future work that V27 now pulls into minimum closure.

Partial baseline:

- `packages/orm/src/models/user-btd-balances.ts` and `user-btd-transactions.ts` wrap compatibility tables `user_credits` and `user_credit_usages`.
- `packages/orm/src/models/organization-btd-treasury.ts` aggregates user holdings but does not own registry supply.
- `internal-docs/BITCODE_EXCHANGE_DATABASE.md` now names the V27 registry/projection table set, but deployment must still apply and prove it.
- `supabase/migrations/001_v26_production.sql` contains compatibility storage and RLS; `002_v27_btd_crypto_registry.sql` starts the V27 range/cell registry and crypto projection constraints.
- UI surfaces can now show holdings, intent, policy id/hash, and AssetPack range posture in the $BTD auxillary.
- auxillary wallet UI can display wallet posture; the V27 signer/session/transaction lifecycle exists in package primitives but is not wired to live adapters.
- BTC fee receipt and PSBT-style lifecycle primitives exist, but no broadcaster or confirmation reconciler is wired yet.
- demonstration settlement primitives can account for source-to-shares value and now witness V27 crypto receipts, but not external chain observations.
- V27 drafts previously left normalized Bitcode volume as an open scalar class; WDRR closes it as proof-addressable semantic volume while leaving exact measurement algorithm as implementation work.
- V27 drafts previously treated public testnet/signet generically; WDRR makes signet canonical for public Bitcoin proof and public testnet supplementary.
- V27 drafts previously treated Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor paths as peer candidates; WDRR makes Bitcoin primary and Ethereum secondary or optional.

Post-promotion deferrals:

- no persisted/generated total V27 minted range proof family;
- no persisted/generated total V27 receipt replay proof family;
- no live wallet adapter over the V27 signer-session boundary;
- no Bitcoin transaction broadcaster/reconciler for fee payment;
- no Taproot or other Bitcoin AssetPack anchor path;
- no Ethereum AssetPack registry/event path;
- no signet proof lane harness;
- no explicit Ethereum-secondary boundary in implementation code;

Promotion closure covers the generated proof appendix, research rebinding, token/range route, unversioned route posture, minimal API persistence boundaries, and proof-family accepted equivalents. Remaining items are operational rollout or later-version implementation depth, not V27 promotion blockers.

## Accepted Deferrals

The following are not V27 blockers unless a V27 invariant requires a minimal hook:

- full Exchange trading product beyond minimal rights transfer and buy/sell/bid/ask;
- high-volume order books or external markets;
- wrapper liquidity;
- value-bearing mainnet launch before operational approval;
- broad external interface propagation;
- complete Terminal product redesign beyond V27 transaction families;
- final legal templates for every future access policy class.

The following were V27 blockers and are closed by Gates 10-16:

- no actual BTC fee broadcaster/observer proof path;
- no live PSBT user signing adapter proof path;
- no ledgerized AssetPack anchor proof path;
- no proof-addressable semantic volume measurement proof;
- no minimal existing-`$BTD` acquisition or rights-transfer proof path;
- no Terminal journal diff proof;
- no ledger/database reconciliation proof;
- no testnet and mainnet-ready operational controls;
- no web-rebound crypto/library selection proof before normative dependency choices are finalized.

## Promotion Discipline

V27 may not be promoted by draft prose alone.

Promotion requires:

- complete spec family;
- implementation parity;
- tests;
- generated proof artifacts;
- generated proof appendix;
- no blocking parity rows;
- and deliberate `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer update.
