# Bitcode Spec V29 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V29`
- V29 state: draft target opened; parity now tracks V29 gates over active V28 canon
- Current canonical/latest target: `V28`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V28.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: draft `.bitcode/v29-spec-family-report.json`, draft `.bitcode/v29-canonical-input-report.json`, future `.bitcode/v29-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, and no `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_PROVEN.md` until promotion
- Source parity state: Gate 1 parity is documentation/workflow/checker closure; product-source rows start as pending V29 gate work
- State: draft target parity matrix opened
- Active canonical pointer during draft opening: `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` -> `V28`
- Scope: V29 parity ledger for Terminal transaction depth, wallet/BTC operations, Reading pipeline observability, AssetPack disclosure, settlement repair, organization permissions, UX quality, and promotion readiness
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V29.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: none until V29 promotion

## Purpose

The V29 parity matrix prevents Terminal-depth work from becoming vague product polish.
Each gate must name source surfaces, tests, proof evidence, documentation, and accepted boundaries before it closes.

## Audit basis

Gate 1 audit basis:

- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V28.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_DELTA.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_NOTES.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_PARITY_MATRIX.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_PROVEN.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_NOTES.md`
- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.github/workflows/bitcode-gate-quality.yml`
- `.github/workflows/bitcode-canon-quality.yml`
- `package.json`
- `protocol-demonstration/src/canon-posture.js`
- Terminal, Reading pipeline, BTD, pipeline-host, UAPI, and workflow surfaces named by V28 promotion.

No `_legacy/` source is active source truth.

## Gate 5 accepted boundaries

- Gate 5 does not reveal protected AssetPack source before settlement.
- Gate 5 does not perform settlement reconciliation repair; Gate 6 owns ledger/database drift and repair.

## Gate 6 Parity

Gate 6 closes the settlement reconciliation slice by making drift ordinary data instead of hidden operator guesswork.

Accepted surfaces:

- `packages/btd/src/reconciliation.ts` is the canonical reconciliation primitive for ledger observed facts, database projected facts, private metaphysical canonical facts, settlement conservation checks, projection repair receipts, repair actions, drift-kind counts, report state, and proof roots.
- `packages/api/src/routes/btd-crypto.ts` accepts settlement conservation checks and binds reconciliation proof roots into the Terminal journal entry for reconciliation settlements.
- `packages/pipeline-hosts/src/asset-pack-harness.ts` stores `asset-pack/settlement.ledgerDatabaseReconciliation`, includes it in evidence, and streams reconciliation state/repair-action count after ledger readback.
- `uapi/app/terminal/terminal-journal-reconciliation.ts` projects the selected transaction into observed facts, projected facts, canonical facts, drift classes, blocking reasons, repair actions, proof roots, and repair receipts.
- `uapi/app/terminal/TerminalTransactionJournalReconciliationCard.tsx` renders the above as a low-detail operator surface with raw payload still available behind expansion.

Accepted failure states:

- Confirmed ledger facts missing from database projection require operator-approved projection repair.
- Reorged or failed fee/anchor finality blocks settlement unlock.
- Database-only orphan projection blocks until quarantined or matched to a ledger observation.
- BTC fee settlement conservation drift blocks unlock and delivery.
- Post-settlement missing pull-request delivery produces a delivery recovery action without exposing protected source.

Gate 6 completion condition:

- `pnpm run check:v29-gate6` passes.
- Focused BTD, API, pipeline-hosts, and UAPI tests prove repair classification, conservation drift, proof roots, and Terminal repair visibility.

## Gate 5 completion condition

Gate 5 is complete when AssetPack disclosure review is package-owned, postprocess and sandbox harness evidence include source-safe disclosure review roots, protected-source leakage tests fail closed, Terminal renders the disclosure review through the Reading preview surface, gate PR title enforcement is active, focused package and UAPI tests pass, `check:v29-gate5` passes, CI invokes the checker and tests, docs name the implemented source surfaces, and the gate branch is committed and pushed for review into `version/v29`.

## Gate 7 Parity

Gate 7 closes the organization authority slice by making action permission a shared BTD decision instead of interface-local convention.

Accepted surfaces:

- `packages/btd/src/authority.ts` is the canonical organization/interface authority primitive for role checks, explicit grants, wallet binding, registry read access, settlement, explicit confirmation, repair approval, source visibility, and authority proof roots.
- `packages/api/src/routes/btd-crypto.ts` and `uapi/app/api/btd/organization-interface-authority/route.ts` expose JSON-safe authority decisions for application routes.
- `packages/executions-mcp/src/mcp-server/src/auth/middleware.ts` can require interface authority after existing permission and BTD read-access checks.
- `packages/chatgptapp/src/tools.ts` requires explicit confirmation, registry read-access evidence, and organization authority evidence before connected-interface writes.
- `packages/pipeline-hosts/src/asset-pack-harness.ts` stores and emits `organizationAuthority` beside settlement unlock and reconciliation evidence.
- `uapi/app/terminal/terminal-organization-authority.ts` and `TerminalTransactionOrganizationAuthorityCard.tsx` project the selected transaction into authority metrics, blockers, decision rows, proof roots, and raw payload.

Accepted failure states:

- Missing role, insufficient role, or missing explicit grant blocks authority.
- Missing wallet binding blocks fee payment, source unlock, and delivery when those actions require Reader wallet proof.
- Missing or denied registry read access blocks protected-source unlock and delivery.
- Pending settlement blocks protected-source visibility even when role evidence exists.
- Missing explicit confirmation blocks payment, delivery, repair, and administration actions that cross sensitive boundaries.
- Interfaces may deny actions even when the organization role could authorize them elsewhere.

Gate 7 completion condition:

- `pnpm run check:v29-gate7` passes.
- Focused BTD, API, MCP, ChatGPT App, pipeline-hosts, and UAPI tests prove organization holdings, active/expired/revoked license usage, paid delivery admission, unpaid denial, interface denial, connected-interface write gating, harness evidence, and Terminal visibility.
- Gate-quality CI invokes the Gate 7 checker and focused tests.
- Gate 7 does not add broad enterprise RBAC administration beyond Terminal transaction authority; later versions may deepen team policy authoring.
- Gate 7 does not reveal protected source before settlement and does not add versioned API routes or source identifiers.

## Gate 8 Parity

Gate 8 closes the demonstration-origin commercial formalization slice by moving gate-critical helpers behind the protocol package boundary.

Accepted surfaces:

- `packages/protocol/src/index.js` exports canonical posture, spec-family validation, canonical-input validation, canon-posture-drift validation, generated artifact builders, and canonical proven-generation helpers.
- `packages/protocol/src/index.d.ts` declares the same package-native API surface for consumers that type-check against the protocol package.
- `packages/protocol/src/canon-posture.js` declares active V28 and draft V29 while V29 gates are in progress.
- Root scripts for spec-family checks, canonical-input checks, canon-posture drift, spec quality, pre-commit posture, and proven generation import through the protocol package source boundary.
- `packages/protocol/test/protocol-package-boundary.test.js` proves package exports, posture, provenance-helper availability, repository-revision deposit behavior, and direct demonstration-source import boundaries.
- `uapi/tests/protocolCommercialBoundary.test.ts` remains the commercial application boundary scan proving UAPI depends on `@bitcode/protocol` and not the standalone demonstration package.
- `.github/workflows/bitcode-gate-quality.yml` runs the Gate 8 checker, protocol package typecheck/test, and the commercial protocol boundary test.

Accepted boundaries:

- Gate 8 does not delete the standalone protocol demonstration.
- Gate 8 does not forbid generated proof inventories or historical documentation from citing `protocol-demonstration/` as evidence.
- Gate 8 forbids direct imports from standalone demonstration source in commercial/runtime source and root scripts.
- Gate 8 does not promote `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` to V29.
- Gate 8 does not add versioned API routes or source identifiers.

Gate 8 completion condition:

- `pnpm run check:v29-gate8` passes.
- Focused protocol package typecheck/test and the UAPI commercial protocol boundary test pass.
- V29 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, PARITY, protocol package README, package scripts, and gate-quality workflow name the formalized package-native boundary.
- Root scripts use protocol package exports for canonical helpers and do not directly import `protocol-demonstration/src/*`.
