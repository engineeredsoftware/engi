This DELTA records what V28 intends to change relative to V27.
V28 starts as a draft family only.

## Why V28 Exists

V27 closed the core `$BTD` law and minimum practical crypto rails:

- 21,000,000-cell non-fungible `$BTD` registry;
- AssetPack ranges as commercial units;
- measureminting decay;
- zero-cell/refit tail receipts;
- owner-read and licensed-read separation;
- BTC as the fee asset;
- wallet signer-session and BTC fee receipt primitives;
- ledger anchor, minimal Exchange, Terminal journal, reconciliation, telemetry, and upgrade primitives.

Those primitives are technically coherent but not yet commercially Protocol-operable through Terminal and the first interface surfaces.
V28 exists to make the active Protocol/Terminal surfaces commercially MVP-readable, with Auxillaries readiness cleanup, MCP API, ChatGPT App, BTD-AssetPack minting, realistic testnetting, wallet/BTC flow, and demonstration-to-commercial package separation treated as first-class QA work before deeper Terminal expansion.
Exchange and website Conversations are no longer V28 closure work.

## Delta Contract

V28 changes Bitcode by turning V27's package/API/receipt primitives into commercial Protocol/Terminal MVP workflows.

V28 must make all of these implementation-derivable:

- commercial route QA across Terminal, Auxillaries, BTD range disclosure, MCP API, ChatGPT App, auth/readiness, wallet/BTC/testnet paths, and navigation;
- Auxillaries contained tabs-left experience with old orbital style conflicts removed from active paths;
- Exchange and website Conversations disabled or hidden for V28 QA and deferred beyond V35;
- route-level flags disable direct Exchange and website Conversations entry during V28 QA;
- Terminal wallet readiness and signer-session review;
- BTC fee transaction preparation, signing, broadcast, finality, and failure display;
- Read review and Fit review as explicit pre-settlement boundaries;
- realistic synthetic measurement receipts, BTD-AssetPack minting, ledgerized journal rows, and projection/reconciliation readback in testnet-ready lanes;
- measureminting entitlement and zero-cell/refit posture in the operator flow;
- AssetPack range details from registry state;
- owner-read/licensed-read/denied access decision surfaces;
- Terminal journal diff and ledger/database reconciliation detail;
- organization/team/read-license readiness from registry-derived facts;
- MCP API and ChatGPT App action gates based on range/read-license/policy truth;
- operational health over deployment lanes, telemetry, upgrades, migrations, and rollback state;
- commercial package/UAPI implementations that no longer depend on runtime imports from `protocol-demonstration/`;
- honest connected-provider readiness while broader provider/interface work remains staged beyond V28.

V28 must not:

- introduce versioned implementation routes;
- redefine `$BTD` supply;
- make `$BTD` a fee or spend token;
- rely on compatibility aggregate balances as canonical range ownership;
- approve value-bearing mainnet launch without operational approval;
- include Exchange or website Conversations in V28 closure.

## Research-Informed Chain Boundary

The BitVM/Taproot/BNB/Binance research is incorporated as V28 planning guidance:

- Bitcoin Taproot, PSBT, BIP340/BIP341/BIP342, and wallet-controlled signing remain V28's practical cryptographic center.
- BitVM is compatible with Taproot and useful for future Bitcoin-side bridge research, but it is not a V28 production dependency.
- BSC/opBNB/BEP-20/Binance Web3 Wallet pilots are future bridge/distribution work; they do not define the V28 `$BTD` chain of record.
- BNB Chain is EVM-compatible and therefore bridge-mediated for Taproot/BitVM truth rather than a native Taproot execution lane.
- V28 may expose disabled or documentation-only readiness for BSC/opBNB/Binance pilots, but must not imply live public BTD deployment on those chains unless a proof-bound testnet artifact exists.

## Accepted V28 decisions

- V28 is commercial Protocol/Terminal MVP first.
- V27 remains active canon during V28 drafting.
- V28 productizes V27 primitives rather than redefining tokenomics.
- Terminal, Auxillaries, BTD disclosure, MCP API, and ChatGPT App read models must be registry-derived where they speak about `$BTD`, fees, rights, or readiness.
- UAPI route implementations remain unversioned.
- Source implementation names remain unversioned and ungated unless explicitly required for a bounded compatibility artifact; V28 must not introduce route, file, stylesheet, constant, class, or test names such as `api/v1`, `v27-*`, `first-gate-*`, or `wip-*`.
- value-bearing mainnet remains separately approval-gated.
- User-facing Terminal vocabulary is now Deposit/Depositing and Read/Reading. Retired Deposit/Depositing and Read/Reading language may survive only in compatibility carriers such as persisted enum values, route names, schema fields, proof IDs, and filenames until a separately specified migration replaces those carriers.
- V28 Terminal QA order is Deposit first, then Read/Fit. Read/Fit acceptance is not meaningful until a repository/branch/commit source deposit or equivalent source posture exists as candidate supply.

## Explicitly deferred

- V29 owns deeper Terminal workflows beyond MVP QA.
- V30 is reserved for post-V29 Protocol/BTD hardening discovered during V28/V29; Exchange moves beyond V35.
- V31 owns deeper Auxillaries beyond V28 active-shell cleanup.
- V32 owns deeper provation and testing.
- V33 owns deeper Interfaces beyond the V28 MCP API and ChatGPT App MVP.
- V34 owns deeper Deployment, including host capabilities, real executions, distributed compute, runtime/storage expectations, and canonical-promotion CI/CD.
- V35 owns deeper telemetry and documenting across internal codebase docs plus public `/docs` usage material.
- V36+ owns deeper Exchange and website Conversations work after V35 telemetry/documenting.
- broad Exchange market depth, wrappers, liquidity, advanced market flows, and website Conversations remain out of V28.
- final legal templates may be drafted in V28 but broader legal-product expansion is not a promotion blocker unless Terminal copy claims rights that are not policy-bound.

## Pre-Implementation Sequence

1. Confirm V27 active pointer and V28 draft target.
2. Close V28 Gate 1 by synchronizing SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, PARITY, posture carriers, and route scans.
3. Close commercial Protocol/Terminal MVP QA baseline across primary routes.
4. Clean Auxillaries active shell to the contained tabs-left model.
5. Build Terminal wallet, BTC fee, Read/Fit, synthetic measurement, BTD-AssetPack minting, range, read-right, journal, ledgerization, and reconciliation surfaces to MVP.
6. Build MCP API and ChatGPT App MVP gates over registry-derived read/write authority.
7. Build organization/access-policy and operational-health surfaces at MVP depth.
8. Commercialize remaining demonstration-derived runtime dependencies into packages/UAPI and prove commercial code does not import `protocol-demonstration/`.
9. Generate proof artifacts and promote only after tests/builds/QA pass.

## Commit-Body Direction

The eventual V28 promotion commit body must describe commercial Protocol/Terminal MVP QA over V27 tokenomics, list gate closures, name tests/builds/proofs/visual QA, state route-versioning discipline, name MCP API and ChatGPT App MVP closure, and explicitly defer deeper Terminal work to V29, Protocol/BTD hardening to V30, deeper Auxillaries to V31, deeper provation/testing to V32, deeper Interfaces beyond the V28 MVP to V33, deeper Deployment to V34, deeper telemetry/documenting to V35, and Exchange/website Conversations to V36+.

## From V27 To V28

| V27 source truth | V28 delta |
| --- | --- |
| commercial application routes render but still contain mixed visual generations | V28 makes active routes MVP-coherent through QA, visual cleanup, route checks, and browser proof |
| Auxillaries retained orbital-era shell styles while adopting contained tabs-left panes | V28 removes conflicting orbital layout from active Auxillaries auth/profile/readiness experience |
| signed-in balance widget used currency-like `$BTD`, a raw pipe separator, explanatory hover title, and acquisition wording | V28 renders BTC and BTD as peer wallet balances, uses a styled separator, shows recent BTD AssetPacks in hover context, shows connected wallet identity in the action posture, and opens the `$BTD` wallet auxillary pane |
| Exchange route exists as a prior minimum commercial surface | V28 disables or hides Exchange from closure and defers Exchange product work beyond V35 |
| `$BTD` supply and measureminting law are implemented in `packages/btd` | Terminal reads measuremint entitlement and zero-cell/refit posture as operator state |
| wallet and BTC fee primitives exist | Terminal exposes wallet connection, signer-session state, PSBT handoff, txid, confirmation, replacement, reorg, and failure state |
| AssetPack ranges exist as package/API/database primitives | Terminal makes range, cells, owner, policy hash, source root, proof root, and ledger anchor state readable |
| access evaluation exists | Terminal separates owner-read, licensed-read, and denied branches with policy context |
| minimal Exchange transfer exists | Terminal uses protocol/settlement readback for V28 and does not depend on Exchange product surfaces |
| Terminal journal primitive exists | Terminal turns journal rows and diffs into ordinary transaction detail |
| reconciliation primitive exists | Terminal displays ledger facts, database projections, metaphysical facts, blocking drift, and repair receipts |
| telemetry and deployment lanes exist | Terminal exposes crypto health, approval roots, upgrade posture, and rollback readiness |
| GitHub is the implemented VCS provider | active surfaces disclose provider readiness and stage broader provider depth outside V28 unless MVP QA requires a narrow hook |
| V27 registry migration exists | V28 executes controlled migration/type-refresh work as Terminal readiness input |

## Gate Delta

### Gate 1: Draft Opening And Promotion Review

Opened by:

- updating active posture carriers from V26/V27 to V27/V28;
- creating V28 SPEC, DELTA, PARITY, and draft-opening proof;
- preserving `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` as V27.

### Gate 2: Commercial Application MVP QA Baseline

Adds primary-route QA, Auxillaries shell cleanup, Protocol/Terminal MVP hardening, MCP/ChatGPT App readiness, and browser/visual proof requirements.
The automated browser layer is the commercial-MVP Playwright suite: product-route readability, micro-interface assertions, stitched user flows, URL-addressable filter state, data-share consent persistence, public docs article coverage, responsive route health, and browser-error cleanliness are required before Gate 2 can close.
The package runner is intentionally serial against one deterministic mock-mode dev server. Its mock harness must own Auxillaries data, model-preferences, data-share, notifications, Terminal activity, BTD mint/read state, and MCP/ChatGPT App readiness so V28 QA validates commercial Protocol/Terminal behavior rather than external account/session availability.

### Gate 3: Terminal Wallet, BTC Fee, And Read-Fit-Measuremint Workflow

Adds wallet, BTC fee, operator-visible measurement, Fit, proof, measuremint, and access-policy review.

### Gate 4: Terminal AssetPack Range Detail

Adds registry-derived range detail and read-right detail.

### Gate 5: Terminal Journal Diff And Reconciliation

Adds transaction detail for journal/database/ledger agreement and repair.

### Gate 6: Terminal Organization And Access Policy

Adds registry-derived organization, MCP API, ChatGPT App access decisions, and policy templates.

### Gate 7: Terminal Operations And Testnet Readiness

Adds Terminal-operated deployment lane, telemetry, upgrade, migration, and provider readiness state.

### Gate 8: V28 Metadevelopment And Promotion Proof

Adds branch policy, quality commit discipline, gate workflow hardening,
canonical promotion automation, V28 promotion-script support, unversioned-route
checking, deterministic ledgerized model posture checks, and a carryforward
audit for the product gates that follow.

### Gate 9+: Commercial Product Closure Gates

Gate 9 and later gates close the remaining commercial product flow: Depositing,
Read Request, Read-Need synthesis/review/resynthesis, Finding Fits, AssetPack
preview, BTC settlement, read-license/right transfer, protected-source unlock,
PR delivery, Terminal UX, documentation, proof coverage, and live validation.

Gate 9 introduces the deposited-source evidence spine that later gates consume.
Depositing now produces proof, measurement, reconciliation readback, lexical
document, vector document, and aggregate depository search roots; projects those
roots through Terminal execution history; and carries them into the Read/Fit
harness deposit reference. The vector document policy is explicit:
`text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dimensions, `deliverable_vectors`, and
`match_deliverable_vectors`.

## Later Version Handoff

- V29: deeper Terminal workflows and transaction operation beyond V28 MVP QA.
- V30: Protocol/BTD hardening discovered during V28/V29, explicitly not Exchange unless a future spec reopens that scope.
- V31: deeper Auxillaries, including expanded profile/connects/interfaces/BTD readiness, provider readiness, and commercial operator settings.
- V32: deeper provation and testing, including stronger proof-family closure, E2E breadth, promotion proofs, and regression matrices.
- V33: deeper Interfaces beyond the V28 MCP API and ChatGPT App MVP, including broader API packaging, interface auth, non-Auxillaries non-website application interfaces, and integratable chatbot surfaces.
- V34: deeper Deployment, including host capabilities, real executions, distributed compute aligned with provations, runtime expectations, storage expectations, and CI/CD for canonical promotions.
- V35: deeper telemetry and documenting, including internal codebase documentation and public `/docs` usage material as the prelude to full commercial application testnet rollout.
- V36+: deeper Exchange and website Conversations, including market depth, order books, range trading depth, wrappers, liquidity, buy/sell/bid/ask flows, and website conversational interface work.
