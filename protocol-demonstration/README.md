# Bitcode Protocol Demonstration - V47 canonical deterministic local prototype

This package is the deterministic demonstration of Bitcode. Within this package
the correct name is demonstration.

`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` is the canonical pointer for active-system work. It currently
resolves to `V43`; V44 is the next draft target after this promotion. This demo is governed by the active V47 canonical
spec and `BITCODE_SPEC_V47_PROVEN.md` as the current generated appendix.
`BITCODE_SPEC.txt -> V47`.
V35 telemetry/documentation work may compare against demonstration facts, but the
demonstration remains self-contained and does not import commercial runtime
telemetry, documentation, dashboard, runbook, or public docs code.

## What This Demonstration Carries

- deterministic Bitcode state, settlement, proof, and branch-materialization logic
- a minimal local fit-finding loop that ranks demonstration deposits for a Read
  and synthesizes a proof-rooted demonstration AssetPack only when the source
  fixture is worthy
- standalone browser/runtime shell under `public/`
- Terminal-facing mount, snapshot, and control bridge through `src/client-entry.js`
- local validation server through `server.js`
- proof/checkpoint generation inputs used by the active specification family

Product surfaces may mount or compare against demonstration runtime facts, but
those surfaces own their own implementations outside this package.

## Main Files

- `src/bitcode-demo.js`: deterministic state engine and local Bitcode chain modeling.
- `src/client-entry.js`: demonstration mount/snapshot/control bridge.
- `src/local-fit-finding.js`: standalone local Need/Need-Fit witness. It
  deliberately avoids pipeline, registry, prompt, agent, Vercel, Supabase, and
  UAPI imports.
- `src/ai-reading-demonstration.js`: V42 AI-reading demonstration MVP. It
  compares a public-data-only AI answer with an AssetPack-enhanced answer after
  local Need synthesis and local Finding Fits, then emits deterministic
  benchmark uplift and source-safe proof roots.
- `src/canonical/proven-generator.js`: generated proof and checkpoint appendix builder.
- `public/app.js`: standalone demonstration behavior.
- `public/index.html`: direct demonstration shell for local validation and parity checks.
- `public/styles.css`: demonstration styling, flow-guide, payload, and help layers.
- `public/telemetry.js`: demonstration diagnostics and operator-visible telemetry labeling.
- `server.js`: local standalone runtime.

## Relationship To Terminal

The primary product review surface is `/terminal`.

The demonstration remains essential because Terminal can mount and read:

- demonstration runtime markup,
- flow-guide/runtime semantics,
- closure/detail snapshot data,
- deterministic controls used for parity checks.

Direct package validation remains useful for runtime parity checks, bridge
debugging, proof generation confidence, demonstration copy/style verification,
and telemetry-label verification.

## Local Commands

Run the standalone demonstration:

```bash
cd protocol-demonstration
npm start
```

Run package tests:

```bash
cd protocol-demonstration
npm test
pnpm test:fit-finding
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:v28-mvp-qa
pnpm test:v42-ai-reading-mvp
```

## V42 AI-reading demonstration

The V42 AI-reading demonstration proves the shortest local reason Bitcode
matters for AI-dominant Reading: a deposited runbook AssetPack improves an AI
incident assistant beyond a public-data-only baseline.

The loop is intentionally minimal and local:

1. synthesize and accept a ReadNeed from a source-bound Read;
2. rank the local Depository and select `deposit-auth-migration-runbook`;
3. expose only source-safe AssetPack preview metadata before settlement;
4. compare the public-data-only answer with the AssetPack-enhanced answer;
5. record deterministic basis-point uplift, query root, ranking root, and
   AssetPack proof root.

The demonstration remains self-contained and does not import product runtime
code.
