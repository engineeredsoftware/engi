# V26 Proof Surfaces

## Status

- Scope: non-canonical supplementary proof and coverage map for V26
- Canonical pointer: `/Users/garrettmaring/Developer/ENGI/BITCODE_SPEC.txt -> V26`
- Next draft target: `BITCODE_SPEC_V27.md` (not yet opened)
- Purpose: map new V26 code systems to proof/test/spec expectations while the largest convergence pass in repo history is underway

## Rule

This file is not canonical proof truth.
Canonical proof obligations live in:
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V26.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V26_DELTA.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V26_PARITY_MATRIX.md`
- and the generated proof appendices/report artifacts when V26 reaches closure

This document exists so V26 implementation can add new code without losing coverage discipline.

## Coverage principle

Any new or newly repurposed V26 system must have all three:
1. specification coverage
2. test coverage
3. proof-surface assignment

V26 does not allow large application glue layers to accumulate without explicit coverage expectations.
The provable space is expected to grow materially in V26 as more package code, application surfaces, and reused component/system carriers are admitted into the converged Bitcode system.

## Gate coverage map

### Gate 2: application UX/UI and external interfacings

Required system families:
- `/application` architecture framing
- native master-detail sections
- conversations overlay entry and app-owned routes
- auxillaries entry, compatibility orbital routing, and app-owned auxillary data
- app-owned VCS surfaces required for connections and repository context

Current active carriers:
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationOperatorCard.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/application-operator-explainers.ts`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationExperienceFrame.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationCommandDeck.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationActionWorkbenchCard.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationExternalInterfacingPanel.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationGiveNeedWorkbench.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationRepositoryContextPanel.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationCoreNativeSections.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationClosureNativeSections.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationLiveSummaryStrip.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationTransactionWorkspace.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationTransactionDetailActionBar.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/ApplicationWorkspaceRail.tsx`
- `uapi/app/application/application-closure-state.ts`
- `uapi/app/application/application-external-runtime.ts`
- `uapi/app/application/application-live-summary.ts`
- `uapi/app/application/application-give-need-workbench.ts`
- `uapi/app/application/application-repository-context.ts`
- `uapi/app/application/application-transaction-query.ts`
- `uapi/app/api/conversations/*`
- `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/data/route.ts`
- `uapi/app/api/vcs/[provider]/*`
- `uapi/app/api/v24/external-realization/route.ts`
- `protocol-demonstration/src/client-entry.js`
- `protocol-demonstration/public/app.js`

Required coverage posture:
- spec:
  architecture, ownership, and acceptance described in `BITCODE_SPEC_V26*`
- tests:
  route tests, UI tests, and browser verification for active entry flows
- proof surface:
  parity ledger rows, explicit closure statements for second-gate acceptance, and generated checkpoint checks that include active README/markdown carriers

### Gate 3: marketing refurbishment

Required system families:
- public website refurbishment carriers
- mounted public-shell vocabulary carriers for landing, footer, `/docs`, and the compatibility `/demo-video` alias
- tooltip/help posture preservation
- separation between application acceptance and marketing iteration
- generated checkpoint artifacts that leave third-gate work explicit instead of implied complete

Required coverage posture:
- spec:
  third-gate scope, timing, and separation remain explicit in `BITCODE_SPEC_V26*`
- tests:
  mounted public-shell copy, CTA posture, and guide-route continuity are covered without making second-gate application acceptance depend on the full marketing backlog
- proof surface:
  first+second-gate closure artifacts must still report mounted third-gate start clearly while leaving broader marketing/public-shell refurbishment explicitly incomplete

### Gate 4: retained-system convergence

Required system families:
- conversations continuity
- runs and pipelines totalization
- Bitcode-native deliverable meaning
- PostgreSQL/Supabase persistence, `/edgetimes`, migrations, schema contracts, ORM/query carriers, and generated database types
- prompt abstraction and prompt-space routing
- retained package admissibility

Required coverage posture:
- spec:
  retained roles and convergence rules are explicit
- tests:
  retained packages and converged routes are covered by behavior tests
- proof surface:
  retained systems are named in the eventual V26 proof family rather than implied
  current live fourth-gate promotion-boundary owners include `uapi/app/conversations/page.tsx`, `uapi/app/conversations/ConversationsRouteClient.tsx`, `uapi/app/executions/page.tsx`, `uapi/app/executions/[runId]/page.tsx`, `uapi/app/api/executions/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/vcs/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/templates/deliverables/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/template-preferences/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/profile/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/connections/github/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/btd/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/usage/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/transactions/route.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/api-keys/route.ts`, `uapi/app/edgetimes/edgetimes-topology.ts`, `uapi/app/edgetimes/EdgetimesPageContent.tsx`, `uapi/app/edgetimes/page.tsx`, `uapi/app/api/edgetimes/route.ts`, and the focused route/API tests proving those surfaces
  active API-boundary proof now also includes the route-owner split for conversations: `uapi/app/api/conversations/{route,branch/route,stream/route,[conversationId]/stream/route}.ts` must stay as thin interface bindings over `packages/api/src/routes/conversations.ts`, while deeper conversation behavior remains in `packages/api/src/conversations/*` rather than drifting back into the Next.js filesystem routes; route bindings may use the specific `@bitcode/api/src/routes/conversations` entry rather than an eager top-level API barrel when isolated loading is required
  active API-boundary proof now also includes the route-owner split for executions history: `uapi/app/api/executions/{route.ts,history/route.ts,history/[runId]/route.ts}` must stay as thin interface bindings over `packages/api/src/routes/{deliverables,executions}.ts`, while execution-history normalization and persistence orchestration remain in the API package rather than drifting back into app-owned route files; route bindings may use specific `@bitcode/api/src/routes/{deliverables,executions}` entries when isolated loading is required
  current generated fourth-gate promotion proofs are `.bitcode/conversations-continuity-proof.json`, `.bitcode/runs-pipelines-totality-proof.json`, `.bitcode/persistence-schema-totality-proof.json`, `.bitcode/prompt-system-totality-proof.json`, and `.bitcode/retained-package-admissibility-proof.json`
  retained-package admissibility now also has to state old-world port roles explicitly, including Jira as reader-first need ingestion and Git/GH as the initial settle-write boundary
  retained MCP proof carriers are now explicit too: `packages/executions-mcp/src/mcp-server/src/__tests__/{tools/MCPToolsTestSuite.test.ts,integration/mcp-server.test.ts,unit/auth.test.ts}` must stay green against the current server surface and must not emit lingering Jest open-handle warnings, with imported singleton intervals handled as real runtime teardown obligations rather than ignored test noise
  active email-template carriers are explicit fifth-gate witnesses too: `supabase/config.toml`, `supabase/templates/{magic_link,confirm,password_recovery,email_change,invite,newsletter,deliverable_*}.html`, and the active deliverables email vars in `packages/api/src/routes/deliverables.ts` must converge on Bitcode naming and current placeholder contracts rather than leaving `Engi` product copy in live email/auth flows
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover the retained `@bitcode/prompts` package so prompt-system code, metadata, and promptpart identity text do not silently regress back to `Engi` naming after fourth-gate promotion
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover prompt-system JS carry-through and review-tooling carriers such as `packages/prompts/src/{index.js,parts/PromptPart.js}`, `scripts/phase2-naming-compliance.py`, and `scripts/code-review/{REVIEW_EXCELLENCE_GUIDE.md,reviews/review_prompt_primitives_evolution*.sh}`, so generated JS comments, script-owned repo paths, and review references to current `raw_promptparts/*` files cannot silently preserve old-brand wording or dead prompt filenames
  fifth-gate prompt/inference witnesses now also cover the retained `danger-wall` corridor as Bitcode need/AssetPack risk-admission support through `packages/generic-agents/danger-wall/*`, `packages/prompts/src/raw_promptparts/specific/promptpart_specific_agent_dangerwall_*`, `protocol-demonstration/test/v26-danger-wall-agent-compatibility.test.js`, and `protocol-demonstration/src/canonical/inference-implementation-records.js`, so old generic security, content-safety, and monitoring-product semantics cannot silently survive in a live retained setup gate
  package-by-package prompt consumer mapping is now also explicit in `protocol-demonstration/V26_PROMPT_SURFACES.md`, and active app configs such as `uapi/tsconfig.json` no longer keep `@bitcode/prompts/src/*` compatibility aliases on the live path
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover prompt/tooling repair scripts such as `scripts/{fix-remaining-imports,fix-barrel-imports,fix-multiline-imports,fix-corrupted-imports}.sh` and `scripts/code-review/base-review.sh`, so active script repair targets and review output paths cannot silently preserve `@engi/*` rewrite contracts or `/tmp/engi_review_*` runtime artifacts
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover maintenance validation and cleanup carriers such as `scripts/verify-deliverables-quality.sh`, `scripts/{cleanup_remaining_docs.py,cleanup_outdated_docs.py,cleanup-outdated-docs.sh}`, and `protocol-demonstration/CHECKLIST.md`, so active operator validation logic, cleanup target lists, and demo-checklist guidance cannot silently preserve `@engi/*`, `engi-demo`, `Make ENGI branch`, or `ENGI_*` document targets
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover live public-shell style carriers and retained package surfaces such as `@bitcode/chatgptapp`, `@bitcode/web-search`, `@bitcode/streams`, and `@bitcode/email`, with the expectation that user-facing strings, active identifiers, package docs, and canonical package comments all converge on Bitcode naming rather than lingering old-brand residue
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover mounted public-shell teaching carriers and retained package docs such as `uapi/app/(root)/components/{MarketingFeaturesGrid,MarketingComputeSection,MarketingCompetitorTableSection,MarketingMarketplaceSection}.tsx`, `uapi/app/orbitals/components/OrbitalsConnectsOrbitalEmailConnection.tsx`, and `packages/{web-search,registry}/*`, so public demo-like terminal strings, active classnames/comments, and retained registry/web-search docs cannot silently drift back to old-brand wording
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover user-facing package API route strings in `packages/api/src/routes/*`, so auth welcome flows, ChatGPT success messages, and deliverables permission guidance cannot silently keep old-brand naming while the mounted product surfaces read as Bitcode
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover retained shared contracts such as `@bitcode/errors` and direct consumers like `packages/api/src/routes/deliverables.ts` and `uapi/app/error.tsx`, so exported symbols, docs, and active error teaching cannot silently keep old branded error-contract naming after promotion
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover live webhook and mock-system carriers such as `uapi/app/api/webhook/{route,verify}.ts`, `uapi/tests/webhookRoute.test.ts`, `uapi/mocking/index.ts`, `uapi/mocking/integration/MockProvider.tsx`, `uapi/mocking/generators/ComprehensiveMockDataGenerators.ts`, `uapi/mocking/{README.md,INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md,QUICK_START_*.md,COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md,validate-system.js}`, and `uapi/mocking/scripts/*`, so trigger labels, comment commands, browser debug globals, shipped operator docs, and script ownership paths cannot silently drift back to `engi-*`, `__engiMock*`, or stale `app/mocking` product truth
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover canonical auxillary-pane ownership and retained LLM harness config, including `uapi/app/auxillaries/components/AuxillariesSurface.tsx`, `uapi/app/auxillaries/components/Auxillaries{Profile,Connects,Interfaces,BTD}Pane.tsx`, `uapi/app/orbitals/components/Orbitals{Profile,Connects,Interfaces,BTD}Pane.tsx`, `packages/llm-generics/{jest.config.cjs,tsconfig.test.json,__mocks__/*,README.md}`, `jest.base.cjs`, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so active route ownership and workspace test/runtime config cannot silently preserve orbitals-pane implementation ownership, `engi-*` mock filenames, `@engi` transform allowlists, or dead Engi-era workspace entries
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover shipped JS/runtime carry-through and Storybook/docs carriers such as `packages/{errors,logger,observability}/*.js`, `packages/{security,multimodal-utils,tech-types,supabase}/*`, and active `uapi/stories/*`, so generated runtime artifacts, package docs/comments, and operator-facing story/example copy cannot silently preserve `@engi/*`, `Engi`, or Engi-branded sample values after Bitcode promotion
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover canonical auxillary step aliases and retained teaching/example carriers such as `uapi/app/auxillaries/components/Auxillaries{Credits,Connects,Models,ProfileStep}.tsx`, active test imports under `uapi/tests/{creditsStep*,connectionsStep*,modelsStep*,profileStep*,orbitals*}.tsx`, retained docs/examples in `packages/{doc-comment,figma,generic-tools,system-grep,testing,executions-mcp}/*`, and active e2e/story fixtures like `uapi/tests/e2e/conversation-digest-pipeline.test.ts`, `uapi/tests/e2e/fixtures/stories/killBug.json`, and `uapi/stories/{SourceDivider,SourceConfig}.stories.tsx`, so fifth-gate proof covers canonical auxillary ownership in tests and the remaining sample-product teaching layer rather than stopping at runtime/package code alone
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover the Bitcode root spec/toolchain family and the auxiliary-focused story/test import layer, so `BITCODE_SPEC*.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`, `scripts/*bitcode*.mjs`, and active Storybook/test carriers such as `uapi/stories/{LoginPane,OnboardingPane,user/Auth,user/Onboarding}.stories.*` plus `uapi/tests/{orbitalsPaneTabs,orbitalsWorkspacePanels,orbitalPaneMeta}.test.*` cannot silently regress to root `ENGI_SPEC*` paths or compatibility `orbitals` imports when canonical auxillary carriers already exist
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover non-_legacy historical path carriers such as `BITCODE_{V10,V11}_PREP_MEMO.md` and `protocol-demonstration/BITCODE_DEMO_SPEC_V15*.md`, so root/package historical docs do not keep teaching `ENGI_*` filenames outside `_legacy/`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover canonical auxillary lower-level implementation carriers such as `uapi/app/auxillaries/components/{headers/*,shared/*,models/*,AuxillariesDataSharingPanel.tsx,auxillary-pane-explainers.ts,profile-pane.module.css}`, so canonical pane files do not silently keep orbitals-owned header/shared/model/data-share/explainer imports after the auxillary surface has already become the active owner
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover retained orbitals lower-level compatibility carriers such as `uapi/app/orbitals/components/{headers/*,shared/*,models/*,OrbitalsDataSharingPanel.tsx,orbital-pane-explainers.ts}`, so those paths remain thin compatibility re-exports rather than silently preserving duplicate live implementations after canonical auxillary equivalents exist
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover canonical auxillary onboarding/data contracts and active external-realization witnesses such as `uapi/app/auxillaries/auxillary-onboarding-contract.ts`, `uapi/app/api/auxillaries/{onboarding,data}/route.ts`, `uapi/hooks/useUserData.ts`, `uapi/app/auxillaries/components/AuxillariesSurface.tsx`, `uapi/tests/{orbitalsOnboardingRoute,userDataRoute,api/externalRealizationRoute,applicationExternalRuntime}.test.ts`, and active Bitcode operating docs like `protocol-demonstration/{CHECKLIST,SCRIPT,BITCODE_DEMO_SPEC_V15,SPEC_V6_GAP_ANALYSIS}.md`, so payload aliases, schema-backed onboarding semantics, env witnesses, and branch-artifact naming cannot silently preserve `models/credits`, `ENGI_V24_*`, or `ENGI_NEED.md`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover live Bitcode-core need-materialization and external-executor carriers such as `protocol-demonstration/src/canonical/{need-measurement,run-artifacts,v24-local-executors,v24-remote-adapters}.js` and `protocol-demonstration/test/{api,workflow.integration}.test.js`, so emitted need artifacts, V24 env controls, local executor schemes, and Bitcode-core sample branch/runtime refs cannot silently preserve `ENGI_NEED.md`, `ENGI_V24_*`, `engi-local://*`, `engi-review/*`, or other Engi-branded active protocol examples
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover active draft/env/measuring contracts and ChatGPT app type carriers such as `protocol-demonstration/data/state.json`, `internal-docs/{LLM_REGISTRY,SECURITY,PHILOSOPHY-AND-VISION}.md`, `tsconfig.json`, `uapi/tsconfig.json`, `packages/procurement/src/quality-assessment.ts`, and `packages/chatgptapp/src/types/protocol-demonstration__*.d.ts`, so live V27 draft paths, LLM/MCP env docs, thesis constants, measuring helpers, and filesystem-level type carriers cannot silently preserve `ENGI_SPEC_V27*`, `ENGI_LLM_*`, `ENGI_ENABLE_MCP_*`, `measureEngi`, or `engi__*.d.ts`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover active canon-posture carriers such as `protocol-demonstration/src/{canon-posture.js,canonical/v22-canon-posture.js}` and `protocol-demonstration/test/canon-posture.test.js`, so the live V26/V27 runtime/report surface reads `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` and `BITCODE_SPEC_{V26,V27,*}` rather than preserving `ENGI_SPEC.txt` or `ENGI_SPEC_V26/V27*` in current canonical posture truth
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover active historical promotion-proof carriers such as `protocol-demonstration/test/v22-canon-drift.test.js`, so the historical V23/V24/V25 promotion family keeps using the current `scripts/{check,prepare,promote}-bitcode-*.mjs` toolchain and `protocol-demonstration/*` runtime fixtures while limiting old ENGI-spec fixture paths to `_legacy/ENGI_SPEC_*`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover the non-_legacy historical matrix/doc family under `protocol-demonstration/{SPEC_V7_COVERAGE_MATRIX,SPEC_V8_COVERAGE_MATRIX,SPEC_V9_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX,SPEC_V10_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX,SPEC_V11_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX,SPEC_V12_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX,SPEC_V13_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX,SPEC_V14_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX,SPEC_V15_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX,BITCODE_DEMO_SPEC_V15}.md`, so preserved lineage does not continue teaching live `ENGI_SPEC.txt`, `make-engi-branch`, `engi-demo/`, or canonical ENGI wording outside `_legacy/`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover the preserved protocol-owner root-sibling move, so `scripts/prepare-bitcode-runtime-canon-promotion.mjs`, `protocol-demonstration/src/canonical/{v21-specifying,proven-generator,v22-canon-posture}.js`, `.github/workflows/bitcode-canon-quality.yml`, `.gitignore`, and `protocol-demonstration/test/{canon-posture,v22-canon-drift,v26-canon-language,v26-active-product-naming}.test.js` cannot silently regress to `packages/bitcode` or `engi-demo` as active filesystem truth after the preserved protocol owner moved to the root-sibling `protocol-demonstration/`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover live env examples, Storybook config, internal docs, and the canon-quality workflow such as `.env`, `.env.local`, `.ga1.env`, `uapi/.env`, `uapi/.storybook/{main,preview}.tsx`, `internal-docs/{README,STYLE,EXECUTION-WORK-SUMMARIES,DEPLOYMENT}.md`, and `.github/workflows/protocol-demonstration-canon-quality.yml`, so checked-in env examples, Storybook aliases/comments, internal-doc teaching, and CI paths cannot silently preserve `ENGI_*`, `@engi/*`, Engi-branded headings, or `engi-demo` workflow segments after the active Bitcode cut-over
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover live marketing/style/operator carriers such as `uapi/app/(root)/components/{MarketingFeatureBento,MarketingFeatureList,MarketingHeadlessMobileShowcase,MarketingSteps,MarketingTestimonialsCTA}.tsx`, `uapi/{components/base/README.md,styles/{CONSOLIDATED_SYSTEM_GUIDE,orbital}.css,tailwind.config.ts,public/email-logo.svg,stories/email-templates/*}`, `uapi/scripts/long-runner-worker.ts`, `Dockerfile.long-runner`, `packages/styling/README.md`, `packages/generic-tools/lsp-query/src/prompts/lsp-context-awareness-composition.ts`, `.ai/PRODUCT.md`, `INVESTOR_MEMO.md`, `VULNERABILITY_AUDIT_2026-04-02.md`, and `.sales/INTRO_PAMPHLET.md`, so active repository truth does not preserve `Engi`, `engi.dev`, `api.engi.sh`, `engi/long-runner`, or `engi/` path ownership after Bitcode cut-over
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover active integration/example/doc carriers such as `internal-docs/{API,TPS,STYLE}.md`, `packages/mysql/README.md`, and `uapi/mocking/generators/ComprehensiveMockDataGenerators.ts`, so Bitcode-owned API hosts, auxillaries ownership, marketplace preview hosts, and package descriptions do not silently regress to `api.engi.software`, orbitals-owned connects-pane references, `marketplace.engi.com`, or `ENGI platform` wording
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover active platform-package and auxillary-teaching carriers such as `packages/{auth,postgresql,jira,supabase}/README.md`, `packages/supabase/src/client.ts`, `packages/templates-generics/{src/types.ts,package.json}`, `internal-docs/STYLE.md`, and `uapi/mocking/{README.md,COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md,generators/ComprehensiveMockDataGenerators.ts}`, so Bitcode platform ownership and User Auxillaries wording do not silently regress to `ENGI platform`, `engi system`, or `User Orbital`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover active protocol/demo telemetry and root-artifact teaching carriers such as `protocol-demonstration/src/{demo-scenario,canonical/v23-bitcoin-demonstration-service,canonical/v20-quality}.js`, `README.md`, `packages/observability/README.md`, `packages/time/README.md`, and `packages/tools-generics/src/{Tool,doc-code-tool/index}.ts`, so Bitcode-owned telemetry ids, stubbed bitcoin carrier ids/examples, generated appendix names, `.bitcode/*` root artifact teaching, and shared package comments/docs do not silently regress to `engi.*`, `tb1qengi*`, `lnbcrt1engi*`, `make ENGI branch`, `.engi/*`, or `ENGI platform`
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover active package-readme and V20 quality-proof carry-through carriers such as `packages/{google-analytics,tech-types,sentry,kubernetes,logger,orm,streams}/README.md`, `packages/orm/src/index.ts`, `scripts/code-review/{README.md,base-review.sh}`, and `protocol-demonstration/test/{v20-quality-summary,v20-operator-transcript}.test.js`, so Bitcode-owned platform wording, need-measurement grounding for `tech-types`, Bitcode review-framework headings, and the historically correct `_legacy/ENGI_SPEC_V20_PROVEN.md` appendix expectation do not silently regress to `ENGI platform`, `ENGI ORM`, `ENGI CODE REVIEW FRAMEWORK`, or stale generated-appendix names in active docs and proof carriers
  fifth-gate proof now also covers direct `tech-types` package usability through `packages/tech-types/{src/tech.ts,src/uniqueTech.ts,src/signals.ts,src/signals-runtime.js,README.md,src/__tests__/tech-types.test.ts,jest.config.cjs,tsconfig.json}`, so the need-measurement vocabulary package remains actually consumable by dependents with a pragmatic `TechType` surface, curated unique-tech helper closure, package-owned signal normalization, and package-local proof instead of carrying misleading examples or unmaterializable type contracts.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers protocol need-measurement follow-through into that package surface through `protocol-demonstration/src/{bitcode-demo.js,canonical/need-measurement.js}` and `protocol-demonstration/test/core.test.js`, requiring canonical `technologyProfile` emission rather than ad hoc stack-hint-only closure.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers the first dependent package hop beyond that normalization boundary through `packages/generic-agents/tech-types-identifier/{src/index.ts,src/technology-profile-contract.ts,src/__tests__/technology-profile-contract.test.ts,README.md}` and `protocol-demonstration/test/v26-active-product-naming.test.js`, so downstream agent packages keep `technologyProfile` as the canonical output envelope instead of re-fragmenting it into local stack-only schemas.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers the constrained dependent-package compile chain for that same example surface through `./node_modules/.bin/tsc -p packages/generic-agents/tech-types-identifier/tsconfig.json --noEmit`, with the shared closure explicitly admitted in `packages/{orm,pipelines-generics,streams,supabase}/*`; the example is not considered closed if its package-local test passes but the actual dependent compile path is still broken.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers the canonical `$BTD` package/application balance surface through `packages/{btd,api,digest,web-search,orm}/*`, `uapi/{app/api/auxillaries,app/application,app/executions,tests,components/base/bitcode/{btd,execution,inputs},stories/BTDInvestmentExperience.stories.tsx,.env.example,README.md,app/orbitals/README.md}/*`, and `protocol-demonstration/test/v26-active-product-naming.test.js`, so active Bitcode package imports, ORM model owners, route payloads, `btdUsed` transaction/workspace processing stats, BTD investment carriers, and public-shell wording do not silently regress to `credits`.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers canonical in-product BTD acquisition and BTD-notification execution through `uapi/components/base/bitcode/btd/{btd-tracker,BTDPrices}.tsx`, `uapi/app/(root)/components/MarketingPricingSection.tsx`, `/auxillaries/btd`, `uapi/networking/api-client.ts`, and `supabase/templates/{low_btd_reminder,out_of_btd,btd_transfer}.html`, so the live BTC→BTD acquisition/balance/transfer flow no longer routes through `app/_legacy`, checkout/Stripe route owners, or old `credit-transfer` / `low-credits-reminder` / `out-of-credits` naming.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers canonical organization treasury and interface-readiness posture through `uapi/app/{auxillaries/components/organization/{BTDTreasuryManagement,OrganizationSettings}.tsx,orbitals/components/organization/OrganizationSettings.tsx,(root)/components/MarketingSetupForm.tsx}` and `protocol-demonstration/test/v26-active-product-naming.test.js`, so active organization-facing treasury guidance stays wallet/BTC/`$BTD`/Connects-native, Stripe-backed credit purchase scaffolding stays deleted, and `uapi/app/_legacy` remains absent.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers canonical auxillary runtime selectors through `uapi/app/auxillaries/components/{AuxillariesProvider,AuxillariesSurface,AuxillariesContent}.tsx`, `uapi/app/auxillaries/components/shared/AuxillariesPaneTabs.tsx`, `uapi/components/base/bitcode/nav/AuxillariesUseButton.tsx`, `uapi/styles/{orbital-global,orbital}.css`, `uapi/tests/auxillariesProvider.test.tsx`, and the active auxillary Playwright specs, so the live runtime/test interface uses `auxillaries-*` portal/open/button/label selectors and portal ids rather than preserving `data-orbital-testid`, `orbital-portal`, `orbital-open`, `orbital-label-active`, or `__orbitalPrefetched`.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers active E2E onboarding and auxillary proof carriers through `uapi/tests/e2e/{auxillaries.helpers,auxillaries.profile,auxillaries.connections.flows,auxillaries.interfaces.flows,auxillaries.navigation,auxillaries.btd.flows,auxillaries.btd.interval.active,auxillaries.btd.chart.nodata,account.btd.visual,onboarding.visual,onboarding-full-flow}.spec.ts`, so active Playwright filenames, onboarding-state helpers, test titles, and snapshot ids teach auxillaries and `$BTD` rather than preserving `orbital.*` and `credits.*` as active Bitcode product truth.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers devex-side package and mock closure through `uapi/package.json`, absent `uapi/{package-lock.json,pnpm-lock.yaml}`, and `uapi/mocking/*`, so nested lockfiles, deleted checkout remnants, and `USER_CREDITS` / `ORGANIZATION_CREDITS` / `CREDIT_TRANSACTIONS` cannot silently reintroduce Stripe or credit-era truth after the live Bitcode surface has been cut to wallet/BTC/`$BTD`.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers MCP-side `$BTD` budgeting and settlement semantics through `packages/executions-mcp/src/mcp-server/src/{types,auth/middleware,pipeline-execution/adapter,tools/pipeline-tools,tools/orchestration-tools,resources/*,__tests__/*,docs/openapi-generator.ts,server.ts}`, requiring `btdBalance`, `manageBtd`, `minimumBtd`, `estimatedBtd`, and `btdUsed` across auth, execution, metrics, fixtures, and published machine-interface surfaces rather than preserving `creditBalance`, `manageCredits`, or `creditsUsed` as live Bitcode truth.
  fifth-gate proof now also covers Bitcode acquisition and asset-pack execution storytelling through `uapi/app/(root)/components/MarketingBtdInvestmentExperience.tsx`, `packages/executions-mcp/src/mcp-server/{ARCHITECTURE.md,docs/public/mcp-overview.md,src/__tests__/fixtures/MCPTestFixtures.ts,src/__tests__/tools/MCPToolsTestSuite.test.ts}`, `uapi/stories/conversations/{RichTextInput,Pickers,PipelineIntegration,CompleteSystem}.stories.tsx`, and `uapi/tests/api/deliverables.test.ts`, so wallet-gated BTC settlement, GitHub-before-transacting posture, asset-pack execution, and `$BTD` planning remain the active interface story rather than Stripe checkout or credit-era investment narration.
  fifth-gate proof also preserves the settlement accounting boundary: `protocol-demonstration/src/canonical/settlement.js` may keep journal `debits` and `credits` only as exact accounting-entry semantics, while product-denominated balance, spend, UI, route, and MCP carriers stay BTC/`$BTD`.
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover preserved-protocol runtime posture carriers such as `protocol-demonstration/{src/bitcode-demo.js,src/canon-posture.js,test/e2e.test.js}`, so active runtime branch namespaces, operator wait states, and canon/spec-family posture remain Bitcode-only and do not silently regress to `engi/remediation-*` or an `ENGI_SPEC` fallback in live runtime and interface proof
  fifth-gate active-product naming witnesses now also cover the canonical auxillary-onboarding contract and reserved need-measurement teaching layer such as `uapi/app/{application/application-run-data.ts,api/auxillaries/onboarding/route.ts,api/auxillaries/notifications/_shared.ts}`, `uapi/hooks/useConversationStream.ts`, `uapi/mocking/middleware/MockMiddleware.ts`, `uapi/tests/{orbitalsOnboardingRoute,applicationTransactions}.test.ts`, and `internal-docs/{USER-ONBOARDING-AND-SETTINGS,TPS,FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE,DB,API,EXECUTIONS,EXECUTABLE-PIPELINES,STYLE}.md`, so active Bitcode proof also guards the canonical pane payloads, unauthorized onboarding response shape, and need-measurement placeholder posture instead of leaving stale step-only or Measure wording behind in code/docs/tests

### Gate 5: minimum-functional Bitcode Exchange, Bitcode Terminal, and broad old-world reform baseline

Required system families:
- minimum-functional Exchange/Terminal read-write closure
- post-measurement pre-fit Need review with accept/reject/remeasure-with-feedback admission
- present-fit-for-settlement-review surfaces with quantized source-to-shares fit qualities carried into settlement receipts
- environment/debug coherence
- production/staging/development mode completeness
- migration/schema/type/API closure for retained storage systems
- retained-package admissibility proof
- retained old-world kept/cut/isolated reform baseline
- active-source product naming retirement
- fifth-gate closure witnesses for retained app/package/runtime carriers
- proof-bearing closure for newly admitted application, API, MCP, prompt, ChatGPT-app, and retained package systems at the same standard as the earlier proved Bitcode core
- protocol proof closure for `.bitcode/need-review.json`, `.bitcode/settlement-preview.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, settlement AssetPack fit-quality receipts, and `settlement_source_to_shares.quantized_fit_quality_receipting`

Required coverage posture:
- spec:
  final closure conditions are explicit
- tests:
  mode behavior, naming-retirement witnesses, pre-fit need review, quantized fit-quality receipting, and closure gates are exercised

  - `activity`
  - `transactions`
  - `conversations`
  - `auxillaries`
- MVP quality/reread/operator-stability elevation across Exchange, Terminal, Protocol, Proofs, API, MCP, and admitted app surfaces
- ChatGPT-style parity expectations for the in-app conversations surface and the retained ChatGPT app surface

Required coverage posture:
- spec:
  MVP elevation obligations are explicit
- tests:
  MVP product paths are exercised as one coherent Bitcode product rather than a minimum-functional bring-up baseline
- proof surface:
  later-gate MVP artifacts explicitly name what was elevated beyond fifth-gate minimum functionality

### Gate 7: initial commercially-viable testnet live-launch refinement

Required system families:
- commercially-credible operator and launch posture on testnet
- Exchange/Terminal/Protocol/Proof/API/MCP/app alignment as one launch-ready product story
- live-launch quality refinement beyond MVP sufficiency

Required coverage posture:
- spec:
  commercial testnet refinement obligations are explicit
- tests:
  launch-critical operator and interface paths are exercised as one product story
- proof surface:
  later-gate launch artifacts explicitly name what was refined beyond MVP quality

### Gate 8: whole-repository provation and final V26 closure

Required system families:
- whole-repository production satisfaction
- prompt-space completeness
- total V26 closure
- final application/API/MCP/ChatGPT-surface alignment

Required coverage posture:
- spec:
  total repository closure is explicit
- tests:
  whole-repository final witnesses exercise the kept V26 system as one Bitcode application
- proof surface:
  generated V26 proof appendix and reports become seventh-gate final closure blockers

## Whole-repository proof closure

V26 proof closure must extend beyond the former demo core.

Required closure posture:
- the retained and repurposed whole repository that remains in V26 production canon must be proven up to Bitcode-grade satisfaction
- any package, component family, route carrier, or application subsystem kept for V26 must have explicit spec, test, and proof-surface ownership
- proof closure may no longer terminate at the old `engi-demo` equivalent core alone; it must close over the production application and surviving packages as one Bitcode system

  test coverage:
  `protocol-demonstration/test/v26-active-product-naming.test.js`

  fifth-gate protocol-ledger state-unification closure so the Bitcode Terminal central ledger can project live protocol posture into the same searchable master-detail activity window, suppress review-fallback collapse when protocol state is present, and carry a projected-detail snapshot on protocol rows so selected detail keeps repository/give/need/fit/supply posture even before retained execution-history persistence catches up

  filtered `tsc` verification over the active `uapi` program for the MCP interface corridor
  proof surface:
  fifth-gate MCP interface-precision closure so primitive `@bitcode/mcp` utilities stay distinct from the Bitcode Exchange-facing MCP server, the active docs/source carriers teach `Bitcode Protocol` / `Bitcode Exchange` / `Bitcode Terminal` as one canonical hierarchy, third-party MCPs plus repository/provider connections and attachments are modeled as ingress/input context, and retained deliverable-style outputs are normalized toward Bitcode asset-pack meaning instead of remaining generic deliverable egress

  proof surface:
  fifth-gate retained repository/persistence compile-health closure so the VCS agent layer no longer uses schema values as types, the GitHub provider now emits canonical `VCSCommit.parents` and a synchronous webhook-verification contract, and the active `$BTD` transaction plus deliverable/notification ORM carriers no longer preserve implicit-`any` reducers or null-key statistics drift

## Module namespace proof note

V26 also now treats the `@bitcode/*` module namespace as part of the active proof surface.
That means:
- new active imports must use `@bitcode/*`,
- new workspace package names must use `@bitcode/*`,
- and lingering older ENGI-scoped or other non-Bitcode module references in active source are parity drift, not harmless style debt.
