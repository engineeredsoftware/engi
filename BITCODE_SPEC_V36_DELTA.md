# Bitcode Spec V36 Delta

## Status

- Version: `V36`
- V36 state: active draft target opened; this delta records the planned V35-to-V36 Exchange-depth closure set
- Current canonical/latest target: `V35`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V35.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V35_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: draft `.bitcode/v36-spec-family-report.json` and `.bitcode/v36-canonical-input-report.json`; later gates add Exchange generated artifacts
- Source parity state: V36 source parity begins with Gate 1 roadmap/spec opening and is closed gate-by-gate through Exchange contracts, UI, telemetry, settlement, repair, rehearsal, and promotion readiness
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_NOTES.md`
- Parity companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PARITY_MATRIX.md`
- Generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md` only after V36 promotion
- Scope: V36 draft delta for deeper Exchange over promoted V35 telemetry/documentation canon

## Why V36 exists

V35 promoted telemetry and documentation depth.
That made Bitcode understandable, supportable, observable, and testnet-rollout ready.

V36 exists because Bitcode now needs the Exchange surface to become real product law instead of deferred posture.
Exchange must let enterprise users inspect market-wide activity, list or request rights transfers, buy, sell, bid, ask, cancel, accept, settle, and inspect history while preserving BTC fee separation, non-fungible BTD range identity, source-safe AssetPack previews, settlement finality, repair paths, and ledger/database synchronization.

## Accepted V36 decisions

- V35 remains active canon during V36 drafting.
- V36 gate branches are opened from `version/v36` and merged back only when their gate acceptance criteria are closed.
- V36 owns deeper Exchange: `ExchangeActivityBook`, `ExchangeIntent`, `ExchangeOrder`, `ExchangeRightsTransferPreview`, `ExchangePricingQuote`, `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`, `ExchangeDisputeRepairCase`, and `ExchangeRevenueRoute`.
- Exchange contracts must be package-owned before they are exposed by route handlers, UI state, dashboards, runbooks, MCP tools, ChatGPT App actions, public docs, or generated artifacts.
- Exchange previews disclose measurements, roots, rights posture, fee quote roots, owner posture, settlement state, and denial reasons; they must not disclose protected source, raw protected prompts, wallet private material, secrets, or unpaid AssetPack contents.
- Ledger records and journals remain source-of-truth for ownership, settlement, and finality; database projections are repairable projections.
- Exchange pricing may include measurement weights, measurement volume, liquidity bands, wrapper analysis, and BTC fee quotes only through deterministic auditable quote roots.

## Explicitly deferred

- V37 owns website Conversations product behavior.
- Production-mainnet value-bearing launch remains explicitly blocked until a future promoted canon admits it.
- Bridge chain-of-record implementation remains out of V36.
- V36 does not reopen BTD supply law, Reading pipeline product law, V34 deployment law, V35 telemetry/docs law, or AssetPack source disclosure law.

## Pre-Implementation Sequence

1. Open `version/v36` from promoted `main`.
2. Open `v36/gate-1-exchange-roadmap-opening` from `version/v36`.
3. Create the V36 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY family while preserving `BITCODE_SPEC.txt -> V35`.
4. Refresh `SPECIFICATIONS_ROADMAP.md` so V35 is active canon, V36 is draft target, and V37 scope remains coherent.
5. Retarget gate-quality and canon-quality workflow posture checks to V35 active / V36 draft.
6. Add `check:v36-gate1` and a V36 Gate 1 checker.
7. Define V36 gates, acceptance criteria, carryforward parity rows, and post-V36 roadmap responsibilities.
8. Validate spec family, canonical inputs, canon posture, workflows, roadmap truth, README/docs, and diff hygiene.
9. Push the gate branch and open a pull request to `version/v36`.

## Commit-Body Direction

V36 gate commit bodies should describe the closed gate, specification changes, implementation surfaces, tests, proof commands, and accepted boundaries.
The eventual V36 promotion commit body must name all closed V36 gates, generated Exchange proof artifacts, settlement/reconciliation evidence, UI proof, public/internal documentation evidence, telemetry/runbook evidence, local/staging rehearsal proof, and the `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer change from `V35` to `V36`.
It must explicitly defer V37 Conversations depth, bridge chain-of-record implementation, and value-bearing mainnet launch.

## Gate Delta

### Gate 1: V36 Exchange Roadmap And Spec Opening

Gate 1 opens V36 correctly:

- V36 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY files exist.
- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` remains `V35`.
- README, roadmap, PR template, package docs, demonstration docs, and workflows describe V35 active / V36 draft posture.
- `check:v36-gate1` validates branch naming, spec family, notes, parity, roadmap truth, workflow posture, Exchange vocabulary, and promotion boundaries.
- The V36 gate list is explicit before Exchange implementation begins.

### Gate 2: Exchange Activity Book And Market Master Detail

Gate 2 inventories source-safe market activity.

Closure acceptance:

- `ExchangeActivityBook` owns market-wide activity rows, filters, detail payloads, proof roots, event ids, and redaction posture;

### Gate 6: Exchange Settlement Ledger Database Reconciliation

Gate 6 synchronizes settlement.

Closure acceptance:

- `ExchangeSettlementReceipt` binds payment observation, finality state, rights transfer receipt, ledger root, database projection root, object storage root, delivery state, and repair id;
- observers and repair jobs reconcile database projections to ledger truth;
- settlement finality and delivery are auditable;
- `.bitcode/v36-exchange-settlement-reconciliation.json` is generated from the package-owned builder with `source-safe-exchange-settlement-reconciliation-metadata`;

Closure acceptance:

- `/exchange` exposes market-wide master-detail, filters, order history, rights-transfer review, pricing quote, settlement state, and repair state;
- Terminal can hand off to Exchange without losing transaction context;
- collapsed UI gives readable status and expanded UI exposes source-safe detail.
- Exchange telemetry dashboards remain source-safe and proof-rooted.
- `.bitcode/v36-exchange-ux-proof.json` is generated from the package-owned `ExchangeUxProof` builder with `source-safe-exchange-ux-proof-metadata`;

- rehearsal logs/screenshots are source-safe;
- ledger/database synchronization and value-bearing mainnet blocking are visible.

### Gate 10: V36 Promotion Readiness

Gate 10 owns final generated proof, promotion workflow support, source-safe `.bitcode/v36-promotion-readiness-report.json`, and V36 closure.

Closure acceptance:

- V36 promotion checks validate all Exchange artifacts, contracts, UI proof, telemetry/docs/runbook bindings, settlement/reconciliation evidence, repair evidence, rehearsal proof, and generated proof appendix support;
- promotion scripts support V36 command planning, dry-run, generated proof output, and derived promotion commit body generation;
- promotion rewrites runtime posture to active V36 / draft V37 only after validations pass.

## Delta completion condition

This delta is complete for Gate 1 when `version/v36` contains the V36 spec family, roadmap posture, workflow posture, README/package docs posture, PR template title guidance, `check:v36-gate1`, and validations proving V35 active / V36 draft readiness.
