## Version executive summary

V46 opens from promoted V45's knowledge commoditization law. Its job is to make
that law commercially legible and interface-consistent without weakening source
safety: a buyer, depositor, operator, API consumer, ChatGPT App user, or future
AI agent must be able to understand what an AssetPack is, what BTD measures and
rights it carries, why BTC finality gates source unlock, what proof roots exist,
and what can be inspected before and after settlement.

V46 does not replace V45 as active canon until promotion workflow validation.
It is the draft target for external protocol comprehension, public/operator
docs, route copy, interface contract readback, and launch-facing proof
explainability.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode commoditizes technical knowledge by packaging it as AssetPacks.
Depositors form source-safe supply. Readers form measured demand, review Needs,
request Finding Fits, preview source-safe Need-Fit results, settle in BTC, take
BTD rights, and receive entitled repository delivery. Contributor compensation
flows from source-to-shares after final settlement.

V45 already sharpened the law: AssetPack is the commodity, BTC is settlement
money, BTD is Need-relative weighted scalar knowledge-volume whose settled form
carries rights, and proof-backed readback is the only state advancement
mechanism. V46 makes that law understandable, inspectable, and consistent
across human and machine interfaces.

## V46 source-of-truth hierarchy

`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to `V45`; V45 is the active promoted Bitcode canon.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V46_DELTA.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PARITY_MATRIX.md` are draft
target material only. They do not authorize implementation behavior until a
gate-specific V46 parity or implementation gate accepts the relevant scope.

Implementation remains unversioned in source paths. Package, route, component,
test, prompt, script, telemetry, schema, API, and workflow names move in place
as the single current Bitcode system after parity-authorized implementation
gates begin.

## V46 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V46 work must be reconstructable from this formal specification family, source
code, generated artifacts, proof roots, workflow receipts, ledger journals,
database projections, storage roots, wallet/provider receipts, repository
delivery receipts, and operator-safe telemetry.

No V46 surface may disclose protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, raw
prompts, raw model/provider responses, wallet private material, credentials,
private settlement payloads, or private repository access outside entitlement.

## V46 totality and precision enforcement rule

V46 must use protocol words precisely. AssetPack is the traded commodity. BTD
is weighted scalar knowledge-volume and, after settlement, a rights-bearing
receipt. BTC is settlement money. Source-to-shares is post-finality contributor
allocation. Preview is not source disclosure. Quote is not payment. Payment
observation is not finality. Database projection is not ledger truth when it
conflicts with ledger, storage, wallet, provider, or delivery readback.

Every value or state must name whether it is estimate, potential, preview,
quote, observed payment, final settlement, rights transfer, delivery,
contributor allocation, or repair.

## V46 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- Make promoted V45 law externally legible without simplifying away settlement,
  rights, proof, source-safety, or compensation boundaries.
- Align public docs, landing copy, README/operator docs, `/packs`, `/read`,
  `/deposit`, API/MCP, ChatGPT App, and Bitcode Chat around one protocol
  explanation.
- Define source-safe market-activity disclosure: what can be inspected before
  settlement, what is hidden until rights transfer, and what proof readback
  makes auditable.
- Prepare a parity matrix for launch-facing documentation, route text,
  interface schemas, proof explanations, examples, and demonstrations.
- Preserve V45 protocol law unless a later V46 atom explicitly and safely
  supersedes it.

Non-goals:

- V46 draft work does not expose unpaid source.
- V46 draft work does not admit value-bearing mainnet operation.
- V46 draft work does not authorize behavior outside accepted formal parity,
  proof, rehearsal, and promotion evidence.
- V46 draft work does not treat notes, PR bodies, telemetry, or conversations
  as implementation authority.

Design principles: source-safe commodity formation, Need-relative measurement,
BTC finality before rights, proof-backed readback, fail-closed repair,
interface humility, and implementation from formal parity only.

## V46 system architecture and layer boundaries

V46 acts through existing Bitcode layers:

- `/deposit` for source-safe AssetPack supply formation.
- `/read` for Read Request, Need review, Finding Fits, preview, quote, BTC
  settlement, BTD rights transfer, and repository delivery.
- `/packs` for searchable master-detail activity, proof roots, repairs,
  settlement state, delivery state, and compensation state.
- API/MCP, ChatGPT App, and Bitcode Chat as policy-bound windows into the same
  protocol law.
- Package-owned BTD, settlement, source-to-shares, prompt, pipeline, telemetry,
  storage, proof, and workflow primitives.
- Ledger, database, object storage, wallet/provider, and repository readback as
  protocol evidence boundaries.

Demonstration code remains self-contained inside `protocol-demonstration/`.

## V46 canonical domain model

V46 consolidates these canonical objects and states:

- AssetPack, deposit AssetPack option, Depository AssetPack, selected Fit set,
  Need-Fit AssetPack, source-safe preview, withheld source bundle, quote,
  settlement receipt, BTD rights receipt, repository delivery receipt,
  source-to-shares allocation, contributor compensation statement, repair case,
  proof root, execution receipt, ledger journal, database projection, object
  storage root, wallet/provider receipt, and repository delivery receipt.
- AssetPack states: `deposit-option-synthesized`,
  `deposit-option-reviewed`, `depository-assetpack-admitted`,
  `fit-candidates-recalled`, `fit-set-selected`,
  `need-fit-assetpack-synthesized`, `need-fit-assetpack-quoted`,
  `settlement-observed`, `btd-settled-rights-transferred`,
  `source-unlocked-delivery`, `compensated-and-reconciled`, and
  `repair-required`.
- BTD states: `btd-not-applicable`, `btd-potential-measured`,
  `need-fit-measurements-admitted`, `measurement-weight-policy-locked`,
  `weighted-scalar-volume-computed`, `btd-quantized`,
  `measuremint-applied`, `btd-range-assigned`, `btd-quote-bound`,
  `btd-rights-pending`, `btd-rights-transferred`,
  `btd-source-to-shares-allocated`, and `btd-repair-required`.
- BTC states: `btc-not-quoteable`, `btc-quote-issued`,
  `btc-quote-accepted`, `btc-quote-inactive`, `btc-wallet-ready`,
  `btc-psbt-prepared`, `btc-psbt-signed`, `btc-broadcast-submitted`,
  `btc-payment-observed`, `btc-payment-mismatch-repair-required`,
  `btc-finality-confirmed`, `btc-replaced-reorged-or-failed`,
  `btc-settlement-finalized`, `btc-contributor-compensation-routable`,
  `btc-refund-or-escalation-required`, and `btc-settlement-repair-required`.

## V46 commercial protocol comprehension object model

V46 Gate 2 makes the commercial comprehension object model explicit so public,
product, operator, API/MCP, ChatGPT App, Bitcode Chat, and investor-facing
surfaces all explain the same protocol without claiming more than their
evidence supports.

The comprehension object model is source-safe metadata. It describes objects,
claims, disclosure boundaries, evidence authority, and forbidden
interpretations. It does not expose protected source, unpaid AssetPack source,
raw prompts, raw provider responses, credentials, wallet private material,
private settlement payloads, private Read context, or value-bearing mainnet
admission.

Canonical comprehension objects:

| Object | Protocol reading | Claim boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AssetPack` | Packaged technical knowledge commodity; never raw source. | May be explained as deposit supply, previewed Need-Fit pack, or settled delivery only when its lifecycle state is named. |
| `DepositAssetPackOption` | Proposed source-safe supply for depositor review. | May show BTD potential and policy posture, never final BTD, payment, or public source. |
| `DepositoryAssetPack` | Approved searchable supply with protected-source roots. | May be recalled, ranked, and selected source-safely through Finding Fits. |
| `ReadRequest` | Buyer demand input. | Does not itself create a reviewed Need, Fit, quote, BTD, or rights. |
| `ReviewedNeed` | Accepted buyer objective that authorizes Finding Fits. | Enables Need-relative measurement but does not calculate final BTD by itself. |
| `FindingFitsReceipt` | Search, ranking, threshold, provenance, and repair evidence. | May name many candidates and selected Fits without source disclosure. |
| `SelectedFitSet` | One or many admitted Depository AssetPacks accepted for synthesis. | Required for Need-Fit synthesis and final BTD calculation. |
| `NeedFitAssetPack` | New Need-relative AssetPack synthesized from reviewed Need and selected Fits. | Source-bearing internally but withheld until BTC finality and BTD rights transfer. |
| `SourceSafePreview` | Measurements, quality, provenance, BTD posture, quote readiness, and proof roots. | Preview is not source disclosure. |
| `BtdScalarVolumeReceipt` | Need-relative weighted scalar technical knowledge volume. | BTD is not money and not merely a read-right; settled BTD carries rights. |
| `BtcQuote` | Deterministic sats offer bound to BTD volume, policy, network, expiry, and authority. | Quote is not payment. |
| `BtcSettlementReceipt` | Quote/payment/finality/readback evidence. | Observed payment is not final settlement. |
| `BtdRightsReceipt` | Settled rights, source unlock authority, ownership/read/use boundary. | Rights transfer follows BTC finality and reconciliation. |
| `SourceUnlockDeliveryReceipt` | Entitled repository delivery evidence. | Full source crosses only to the entitled Reader boundary. |
| `SourceToSharesAllocation` | Contributor allocation derived after final Need-Fit settlement. | Allocation is compensation routing, not BTD scalar-volume calculation. |
| `ContributorCompensationStatement` | Post-finality BTC compensation readback. | Database projection must reconcile to ledger truth. |
| `ProofRoot` | Evidence root for state advancement or explanation. | Proof can support state but cannot leak hidden payloads. |
| `RepairCase` | Fail-closed blocker for missing or contradictory evidence. | Repair returns to the narrowest source-safe disclosure boundary. |
| `InterfaceClaim` | Any public, product, API/MCP, ChatGPT App, Bitcode Chat, telemetry, or operator statement about protocol state. | Must name claim category, evidence authority, disclosure boundary, and forbidden interpretation. |

Claim authority is evidence-specific. Canonical specification and generated
proof define protocol law; ledger readback governs settlement truth; database
projection is a synchronized projection; object storage roots prove custody and
withheld bundles; wallet/provider receipts prove payment observations and
wallet posture; repository delivery receipts prove entitled delivery;
telemetry is observability only; interfaces guide and inspect; public education
explains but does not create live transaction truth.

## V46 claim taxonomy law

Every V46 explanatory statement is an `InterfaceClaim` and must occupy one
claim category:

- `protocol-law`: formal AssetPack, BTD, BTC, source-safety, rights,
  compensation, proof, and repair law from the specification family.
- `product-guidance`: route or workflow guidance that helps users act but does
  not advance protocol state.
- `operator-evidence`: source-safe operational evidence, proof roots, runbook
  posture, and repair information.
- `investor-framing`: market or deck language; investor framing is not
  protocol law unless reconciled into the formal specification family.
- `telemetry-observability`: execution progress and debug signals; telemetry
  is observability only and cannot advance state by itself.
- `preview-claim`: source-safe pre-settlement measurement and quality
  statement.
- `quote-claim`: BTC quote, expiry, budget, policy, and wallet-readiness
  statement.
- `settlement-claim`: BTC preparation, signing, broadcast, observation,
  mismatch, finality, reconciliation, refund, escalation, or repair statement.
- `rights-claim`: BTD rights-pending or rights-transferred statement.
- `delivery-claim`: source unlock and repository delivery statement.
- `compensation-claim`: source-to-shares allocation or contributor
  compensation statement.
- `repair-claim`: fail-closed blocker, replay, operator action, or repair
  closure statement.

Forbidden claim collapses:

- AssetPack is not raw source.
- BTD is not only a read-right and is not money.
- Deposit option is not final BTD.
- Preview is not source disclosure.
- Quote is not payment.
- Payment observation is not finality.
- Database projection is not ledger truth when stronger readback conflicts.
- Telemetry and conversation do not advance state.
- Investor copy is not protocol law.
- Value-bearing mainnet remains blocked until a promoted canon admits it.
- Bitcode never takes custody of wallet private material.

For V46, investor framing is not protocol law; telemetry is observability only.

The source-safe generated artifact for this Gate 2 atom is
`.bitcode/v46-protocol-comprehension-object-model.json`; it is generated by
`buildV46ProtocolComprehensionObjectModel` and checked by `check:v46-gate2`.

## V46 public/operator claim boundary law

Gate 3: Public Docs, Landing, And Operator Claim Boundaries binds public docs,
landing copy, README surfaces, and internal operator notes to the Gate 2 claim
taxonomy. These surfaces may teach Bitcode, route users, and name source-safe
proof posture, but they must not become protocol-law authority or serialize
private payloads.

Public docs explain; proof readback decides. A public page may say that
AssetPacks are measured technical-intelligence commodities, that BTD records
weighted scalar knowledge volume and settled rights, and that BTC settles value
transfer. It may not claim source disclosure from preview metadata, payment
from a quote, finality from payment observation, ledger truth from a database
row, state advancement from telemetry, or live value-bearing mainnet admission.

Operator notes may name proof roots, generated artifact paths, state labels,
dashboard ids, runbook ids, and repair commands when they are source-safe.
Operator notes must not record secret values, provider tokens, wallet private
material, raw protected prompts, protected source payloads, raw protected model
responses with source, or unpaid AssetPack source.

The source-safe generated artifact for this Gate 3 atom is
`.bitcode/v46-public-operator-claim-boundaries.json`; it is generated by
`buildV46PublicOperatorClaimBoundaries` and checked by `check:v46-gate3`.

## V46 product route comprehension readback law

Gate 4: `/packs`, `/read`, And `/deposit` Comprehension UX Readback binds the
three commercial website routes to the Gate 2 claim taxonomy and Gate 3
public/operator boundaries. These routes may simplify the operator view into a
low-detail default, but each simplification must have expandable source-safe
readback for proof roots, route-owned state, settlement posture, delivery
posture, compensation posture, and repair blockers.

`/packs` is the searchable PackActivity master-detail surface for source-safe
market and portfolio activity. It may expose PackActivity rows, source-safe
measurements, proof roots, market signals, settlement state, compensation
state, delivery state, repair state, governance readback, and accounting
readback. It must not expose protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, raw
prompts, provider responses, credentials, private settlement payloads, or
wallet private material.

`/read` is the five-step Reading route: request Read, review synthesized Need,
request Finding Fits, review source-safe AssetPack preview, and buy
AssetPack/settle. It must name `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and
`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` as the route-owned pipeline ownership readback,
block Finding Fits until a Need is accepted, keep source-bearing AssetPack
contents withheld before payment, and require BTC finality plus BTD rights and
delivery readback before source unlock.

`/deposit` is the five-step source-supply route: connect source, synthesize
AssetPack options, review source-safe options, submit deposit, and read
Depository state. It may expose option measurements, demand roots, policy
roots, estimated ROI, BTD potential, and compensation metadata. It must not
claim final Need-relative BTD at option time and must keep raw source withheld
from the product readback boundary.

The source-safe generated artifact for this Gate 4 atom is
`.bitcode/v46-product-route-comprehension-readback.json`; it is generated by
`buildV46ProductRouteComprehensionReadback` and checked by `check:v46-gate4`.

## V46 interface claim contract law

Gate 5: API/MCP, ChatGPT App, And Bitcode Chat Claim Contracts binds machine,
assistant, conversation, and package-consumer surfaces to the same
`InterfaceClaim` taxonomy as public docs and website routes. These surfaces
may carry requests, responses, tool descriptors, action descriptors, source-safe
rendering metadata, proof roots, denied states, and handoff metadata, but they
must not become parallel protocol authority or serialize private payloads.

The public API is the versionless machine contract for source-safe schema
compatibility. It must expose only source-safe request/response fields, proof
roots, denied repair states, and compatibility posture. It must not expose
protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, raw prompts, provider responses,
credentials, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, or
value-bearing mainnet authority.

The MCP API is the package-owned tool contract for source-safe protocol entry.
It may expose tool registry names, permission requirements, provider binding
blockers, write-admission posture, proof roots, queue metadata, and denied
repair states. MCP does not settle BTC, transfer BTD rights, unlock source, or
deliver source-bearing AssetPacks by itself.

The ChatGPT App is the package-owned assistant action contract for Reading and
delivery-adjacent actions. It may render source-safe Need, Finding Fits,
preview, quote, settlement-blocker, delivery-lock, and proof-root metadata.
It must require explicit write admission for stateful actions and must show
settlement/right/delivery denied states until proof readback authorizes the
next boundary.

Bitcode Chat is the website conversation overlay and stream/handoff surface.
It may guide Reading, summarize route-local state, display source-safe stream
events, preserve proof roots, and hand off to `/read`; it cannot advance
protocol state, settle, transfer rights, unlock source, or bypass Terminal,
route, ledger, wallet, or proof authority.

Package consumers receive stable source-safe contracts and generated readback
metadata. Package exports may help consumers reason about claims, but package
consumers do not get a separate state machine, value-bearing authority, or
source disclosure boundary beyond the same proof-backed protocol law.

The source-safe generated artifact for this Gate 5 atom is
`.bitcode/v46-interface-claim-contracts.json`; it is generated by
`buildV46InterfaceClaimContracts` and checked by `check:v46-gate5`.

## V46 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V46 operator chain is: connect source and organization policy, synthesize
deposit AssetPack options, approve source-safe Depository admission, request a
Read, synthesize and review a Need, run Finding Fits, select one or many
Depository AssetPacks above threshold, synthesize a source-bearing but withheld
Need-Fit AssetPack, preview only source-safe measurements and metadata, quote
BTC sats from deterministic BTD scalar-volume and share-to-fee policy, accept
quote, sign through non-custodial wallet flow, observe payment, confirm
Bitcoin finality, transfer BTD rights, unlock source only for the entitled
Reader boundary, deliver to repository, allocate source-to-shares contributor
compensation, reconcile ledger/database/storage, and repair fail-closed drift.

## V46 consolidated protocol law

Bitcode is the knowledge commoditization protocol and commercial system for
turning source-derived technical knowledge into source-safe, measurable
AssetPacks whose measurements can be weighted and summed into BTD scalar
knowledge-volume when evaluated against a reviewed Need. That Need-relative BTD
volume drives deterministic BTC quote and settlement, expresses
post-settlement rights, controls source unlock, routes contributor shares, and
is audited through proof roots, ledgerized journals, telemetry, database and
storage synchronization, and generated canon.

The traded commodity is the AssetPack, not raw source, raw prompts, provider
responses, loose files, screenshots, telemetry logs, private repository access,
or conversational summaries.

## V46 AssetPack lifecycle law

Every AssetPack-like object must occupy exactly one lifecycle state at every
protocol boundary. Interfaces, APIs, pipelines, proofs, and operator tools must
not collapse deposit options into settled BTD, previews into source disclosure,
quotes into payment finality, admitted Depository AssetPacks into delivered
Need-Fit AssetPacks, or repair cases into successful purchases.

Finding Fits recalls many candidates above threshold when available. The
selected Fit set may contain one or many admitted Depository AssetPacks. The
Need-Fit AssetPack is synthesized from the reviewed Need plus selected Fit set
and is a new Need-relative AssetPack, not disclosure of the underlying
Depository source before settlement.

## V46 BTD scalar-volume law

BTD is the non-fungible, proof-addressed scalar unit of technical knowledge
volume for a Need-Fit AssetPack. Deposit-time measurements may estimate BTD
potential, but final BTD size is computed only after a reviewed Need, selected
Fit set, synthesized Need-Fit AssetPack, deterministic measurement weights,
dedupe proofs, and source-safe proof roots exist.

Every final BTD measurement row must be Need-relative, accepted, deduped,
proof-rooted, and tied to the selected Fit set. Measurement weights are
deterministic protocol policy. Scalar volume uses fixed-point or integer
arithmetic. Rights-bearing BTD exists only after BTC settlement finality and
BTD rights transfer.

## V46 BTC settlement law

BTC is Bitcode settlement money and payment truth. A BTC quote is a source-safe
procurement offer bound to a reviewed Need, selected Fit set, synthesized
Need-Fit AssetPack, BTD scalar-volume/range, deterministic share-to-fee
policy, wallet authority, network, expiry, and proof roots.

Prepared, signed, broadcast, and observed states are not final settlement.
Source unlock, rights-bearing BTD transfer, repository delivery, and
contributor compensation require confirmed BTC finality, quote/payment
conservation, ledger/database/storage readback, and repair-free settlement
receipts.

## V46 interface authority and disclosure law

All Bitcode interfaces are protocol windows into the same AssetPack, BTD, BTC,
proof, ledger, database, storage, and delivery state. No interface is an
independent source of protocol law. `/deposit` forms source-safe supply;
`/read` procures Need-Fit packs; `/packs` inspects activity and proof readback;
API/MCP exposes machine workflows under equivalent policy; ChatGPT App and
Bitcode Chat guide and summarize; public docs and landing pages explain but do
not represent live transaction truth.

Disclosure boundaries are `before-settlement`, `after-preview`, `after-quote`,
`after-payment-observation`, `after-finality`,
`after-btd-rights-transfer`, and `after-repository-delivery`. Each boundary
must fail closed to the narrowest source-safe state when evidence is missing or
contradictory.

## V46 proof readback and operational authority law

Bitcode state advances only by proof-backed readback. No UI row, conversation
message, streamed telemetry item, route response, external provider event, or
workflow log can alone advance AssetPack lifecycle, BTD rights, BTC settlement,
source unlock, delivery, or contributor compensation.

Canonical evidence classes are canonical specification and generated proof
appendix, execution/workflow receipt, ledger journal, database projection,
object storage and protected-source roots, telemetry stream, wallet/provider
receipt, and repository delivery receipt. Telemetry is observability only.
Provider observation is not final settlement until reconciled with quote,
wallet authority, and finality policy.

## V46 gate taxonomy law

V46 gates are classified as `notes-specification-atom`,
`formal-specification-consolidation`, `specification-parity-matrix`,
`proof-only`, `interface-only`, `implementation`, `rehearsal`, or `promotion`.
Formal consolidation follows accepted notes atoms. The parity matrix follows
formal consolidation. Implementation follows accepted parity gaps. Promotion
alone may advance `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`.

## V46 canonical subsystem surfaces

### Depositing and asset supply

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: deposit AssetPack option,
  Depository AssetPack, protected-source storage root, source-safety proof,
  admission receipt, policy root, and source-safe earning potential.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: source is measured into deposit
  options, reviewed by depositor authority, admitted only after source-safety
  and policy eligibility, then indexed for Finding Fits.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: no final BTD size, reader
  ownership, final BTC proceeds, or public source visibility before paid
  Need-Fit settlement.
- Current proof obligations: option synthesis root, review decision root,
  policy root, admission root, storage projection root, and Depository index
  root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: protected source remains outside
  visible Bitcode surfaces and is represented only by custody roots.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: V46 parity gate must audit
  implementation against this formal specification.
- Current accepted boundaries: source-safe depositor supply formation only.

### Reading and prompt/inference ownership

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: Read Request, synthesized
  Need, reviewed Need, Finding Fits receipt, selected Fit set, source-safe
  preview, quote, BTD posture, and delivery receipt.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: Reading synthesizes a Need from a
  request, accepts or resynthesizes it, searches the Depository, synthesizes a
  Need-Fit AssetPack, and withholds source until payment and rights transfer.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: preview, quote, and observed
  payment are non-final and cannot disclose source.
- Current proof obligations: Read Request root, Need synthesis receipt, review
  root, telemetry summary root, selected Fit root, synthesis root, quote root,
  rights receipt, and repository delivery receipt.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: source-bearing pack material may
  exist internally only as a withheld bundle root before settlement.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: V46 parity gate must inspect
  ReadNeed and ReadFitsFinding source, tests, proof, telemetry, and UI.
- Current accepted boundaries: Reader entitlement starts only after BTC
  settlement finality and BTD rights transfer.

### Fit, recall, ranking, and verification

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: search query root, search
  channel roots, candidate provenance roots, ranking root, threshold root,
  selected Fit set root, and verification root.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: Finding Fits searches broadly over
  admitted Depository AssetPacks and selects one or many candidates above
  threshold for Need-Fit synthesis.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: candidate source remains
  withheld, and provisional BTD contribution is not rights-bearing.
- Current proof obligations: query, search, ranking, threshold, verification,
  and selected-fit roots.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: Fits are represented by
  source-safe provenance and protected-source roots before rights transfer.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: parity must audit search,
  embeddings, ranking, telemetry, and readback.
- Current accepted boundaries: recall and ranking are source-safe evidence,
  not source disclosure.

### Selection and materialization

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: Need-Fit AssetPack,
  source-bearing withheld bundle, source-safe preview, measurement vector, BTD
  posture, quote, source unlock root, and repository delivery receipt.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: selected Fits plus reviewed Need
  synthesize a new Need-relative AssetPack, then materialize delivery only
  after settlement and rights.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: no materialized source crosses
  to the Reader before entitlement.
- Current proof obligations: synthesis receipt, withheld-source bundle root,
  preview boundary root, measurement root, settlement root, rights root, and
  delivery root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: source-bearing output is held in
  protected storage until source unlock.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: parity must audit synthesis,
  preview, storage, delivery, and repair paths.
- Current accepted boundaries: source-bearing materialization is delivery
  authority, not preview authority.

### Identity, authorization, and sensitive flow

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: organization policy, wallet
  authority, budget approval, buyer authorization, depositor approval,
  no-server-custody proof, and entitlement boundary.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: policies gate quote acceptance,
  wallet readiness, source criticality, deposit approval, delivery, and repair.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: Bitcode never takes custody of
  wallet private material and never lets policy bypass settlement law.
- Current proof obligations: wallet authority root, budget root, policy root,
  authorization root, and entitlement root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: secrets, wallet private
  material, and protected source are never serialized into public surfaces.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: parity must audit auth, wallet,
  policy, API/MCP, and conversational authorization.
- Current accepted boundaries: authority enables protocol actions but cannot
  override proof readback.

### Disclosure and projection

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: interface read models,
  disclosure boundary labels, redaction receipts, proof roots, repair cases,
  and source-safe statements.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: each surface projects only the data
  the actor may see at the current protocol state.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: missing or contradictory
  evidence returns to the narrowest source-safe state.
- Current proof obligations: ledger/database readback, storage roots,
  entitlement roots, redaction roots, and interface tests.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: unpaid source, protected source,
  raw prompts, raw responses, wallet material, and private payloads remain
  withheld.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: parity must audit `/packs`,
  `/read`, `/deposit`, API/MCP, ChatGPT App, Bitcode Chat, docs, and landing
  surfaces.
- Current accepted boundaries: interfaces guide and inspect; they do not create
  settlement, rights, or source truth.

### Settlement and exact accounting

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: BTC quote, quote acceptance,
  PSBT roots, broadcast receipt, payment observation, finality receipt, BTD
  rights receipt, source-to-shares allocation, compensation statement, and
  reconciliation root.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: deterministic BTD scalar-volume and
  share-to-fee policy generate sats quote; finality authorizes BTD rights and
  delivery; source-to-shares routes contributor compensation after settlement.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: observed payment is not final;
  mismatches enter repair, refund, or escalation.
- Current proof obligations: quote root, wallet root, txid/network/amount
  observation, finality receipt, conservation root, rights receipt,
  compensation root, and reconciliation root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: settlement payloads are
  source-safe and do not carry wallet private material or unpaid source.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: parity must audit BTD, BTC,
  settlement, quote, ledger, database, storage, and compensation code.
- Current accepted boundaries: BTC finality precedes rights, unlock, delivery,
  and compensation.

### Proof contract, witnesses, and replay

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: specification proof,
  execution receipt, workflow receipt, ledger journal, database projection,
  object storage root, telemetry event, wallet/provider receipt, repository
  delivery receipt, and replay report.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: state advances only by required
  proof root plus readback from the relevant boundary.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: telemetry, UI, conversation,
  provider observation, and workflow logs alone do not advance protocol state.
- Current proof obligations: every state advancement must name required
  readback and repair behavior.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: proof artifacts are source-safe
  unless they sit behind entitled storage and delivery roots.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: parity must audit generated
  proof, workflows, checks, replay, and repair coverage.
- Current accepted boundaries: proof-backed readback is the only authority.

## V46 generated canon

V46 generated canon begins with draft spec-family and canonical-input
validation. Later V46 gates may authorize proof-family, source-safe
end-to-end rehearsal, promotion-readiness, and generated proof appendix
artifacts. Until those gates close, V45 generated proof remains the active
canon evidence.

### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

V46 inherits V19 reproducible-canon discipline for deterministic replay,
proof-member matrices, theorem evidence, state machines, volatility, negative
mutation, and contract ledger shape.

### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

V46 inherits V20 operator-quality artifact posture for accessibility,
operator acceptance, performance budget, projection quality, visual regression,
and quality summary.

### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| artifactPath | role | V46 posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v46-spec-family-report.json` | draft spec-family validation report | Gate 1 planned |
| `.bitcode/v46-canonical-input-report.json` | draft canonical input report | Gate 1 planned |

| `BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PROVEN.md` | generated proof appendix | future promotion gate |

### V46 specifying generated artifacts

V46 specifying generated artifacts must include `.bitcode/v46-spec-family-report.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-canonical-input-report.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-protocol-comprehension-object-model.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-public-operator-claim-boundaries.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-product-route-comprehension-readback.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-interface-claim-contracts.json`, all nine V46 proof-family
artifacts, `.bitcode/v46-source-safe-e2e-rehearsal.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-promotion-readiness-report.json`, and future
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PROVEN.md`; each artifact becomes required only when its own
gate closes.

### Shared generated-artifact fields

Shared generated-artifact fields include report id, version, generatedAt,
source commit, input roots, artifact roots, pass/fail status, failures,
warnings, source-safe posture, and repair instructions.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Artifact-specific generated payload fields include BTD scalar-volume rows, BTC
quote and finality rows, source-to-shares rows, disclosure boundary rows,
interface authority rows, readback evidence rows, and gate taxonomy rows.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

Artifacts classify fields as public, source-safe actor-scoped, operator-safe,
entitled-source, secret, wallet-private, provider-private, or repair-only.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The minimum generated appendix rendered contents must include aggregate proof
verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact
per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem
bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories,
scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when
required evidence is missing, stale, contradictory, or unsafe.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture require deterministic outputs,
clean worktree proofs when promotion eventually requires them, and repair
states for missing generated artifacts or stale proof roots.

## V46 validation canon

V46 validation proceeds in order: draft spec-family checks, active V45
promoted-canon checks, canon posture drift checks, small specification atom
checks, formal specification consolidation, parity audit, grouped
implementation tests, proof-only checks, interface proofs, rehearsal,
promotion readiness, and a later promotion workflow.

Gate 1 validates only active V45 plus draft V46 posture:

- `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V45 --mode promoted --current-target V45`
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V46 --mode draft --current-target V45`
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V45`
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V45 --draft-target V46`
- `pnpm run check:v46-gate1`
- `pnpm run check:v46-gate2`
- `pnpm run check:v46-gate3`
- `pnpm run check:v46-gate4`
- `pnpm run check:v46-gate5`

## V46 promotion canon

V46 promotion is future work. It will require every accepted parity row to be
closed or explicitly deferred, source-safety to be preserved, implementation
and proof gates to be green, rehearsal receipts to be replayable, and the
promotion workflow to validate before any standalone `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`
pointer change.

### V46 promotion readiness canon

V46 promotion readiness is not current in Gate 1. A later gate must generate
`.bitcode/v46-promotion-readiness-report.json`, wire any V46 promotion
workflow, bind all required proof-family and rehearsal artifacts, prove
source-safety exclusions, and show direct-main-push blocking before promotion
can be requested.

## V46 appendices and canonical supporting material

V46 supporting material consists of `BITCODE_SPEC_V46.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V46_NOTES.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, future `BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PROVEN.md`,
`BITCODE_SPECIFYING.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_TEMPLATEGUIDE.md`, V46 checkers, and
future generated `.bitcode` reports.

## V46 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

Accepted boundaries:

- V45 is active canon and V46 is draft target.
- V46 formal spec is active runtime law only inside the source-safe,
  entitlement-bound, proof-backed boundaries it states after a later
  promotion.
- No protected source or wallet private material is exposed.
- BTC finality precedes BTD rights, source unlock, delivery, and compensation.
- Proof-backed readback advances state; telemetry observes state.

Reopen conditions:

- A formal V46 section contradicts accepted notes law.
- A parity audit finds a protocol impossibility or unsafe implementation gap.
- A proof, ledger, database, storage, wallet, provider, or delivery evidence
  class cannot satisfy readback law.
- A product surface requires source disclosure before entitlement.

## V46 completion condition

V46 Gate 1 is complete when the V46 draft spec family exists over active V45,
the roadmap names the version focus and tentative gates, the Gate 1 checker is
green, and CI can validate active V45 plus draft V46. The full V46 version is
complete only after later specification, parity, implementation, proof,
interface, rehearsal, and promotion gates close.

## Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Canonical types and surfaces include AssetPack, deposit AssetPack option,
Depository AssetPack, Read Request, Need, selected Fit set, Need-Fit AssetPack,
BTD scalar-volume, BTC quote, settlement receipt, rights receipt, delivery
receipt, compensation statement, repair case, `/deposit`, `/read`, `/packs`,
API/MCP, ChatGPT App, Bitcode Chat, public docs, landing page, proof roots,
ledger journals, database projections, storage roots, wallet/provider receipts,
and repository delivery receipts.

## Appendix B. Proof family closure catalog

The V46 proof family closure catalog binds inference, prompts, static code,
decisions, materialization, authorization, settlement, disclosure, and proof
contracts to generated artifacts and replay.

### Exact proof-family inventory matrix

| proofFamily | proofArtifactPath | memberIds | theoremIds | replayStepIds | witnessArtifactPaths | Current source basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inference-synthesis | `.bitcode/v46-inference-synthesis-proof.json` | Reading, deposit, conversation | typed inference, source safety | synthesize, search, preview | execution receipts | formal V46 law |
| Prompt-completeness | `.bitcode/v46-prompt-completeness-proof.json` | prompts, registries | total prompt catalog | resolve, interpolate | prompt inventory | formal V46 law |
| Static-code-analysis | `.bitcode/v46-static-code-analysis-proof.json` | packages, routes, workflows | source alignment | lint, typecheck | CI logs | formal V46 law |
| Verification-decisions | `.bitcode/v46-verification-decisions-proof.json` | review, quote, finality | actor authority | approve, select, settle | decision roots | formal V46 law |
| Selection-and-materialization | `.bitcode/v46-selection-materialization-proof.json` | Fits, bundle, preview, delivery | source withheld | search, synthesize, deliver | storage roots | formal V46 law |
| Authorization-and-sensitive-flow | `.bitcode/v46-authorization-sensitive-flow-proof.json` | policy, wallet, entitlement | no secret leakage | authorize, redact | policy roots | formal V46 law |
| Settlement-source-to-shares | `.bitcode/v46-settlement-source-to-shares-proof.json` | BTD, BTC, allocation | finality before rights | quote, observe, allocate | ledger roots | formal V46 law |
| Disclosure-boundary | `.bitcode/v46-disclosure-boundary-proof.json` | interfaces | source-safe boundary | preview, quote, delivery | interface roots | formal V46 law |
| Proof-contract | `.bitcode/v46-proof-contract-proof.json` | evidence classes | proof-backed readback | readback, repair | proof roots | formal V46 law |

## Appendix C. Generated artifact contract catalog

Generated artifacts must be deterministic, source-safe by default, explicit
about confidentiality, and fail closed when proof roots or readback evidence
are missing. The draft generated artifacts are `.bitcode/v46-spec-family-report.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-canonical-input-report.json`, all nine V46 proof-family
artifacts, `.bitcode/v46-source-safe-e2e-rehearsal.json`, and
`.bitcode/v46-promotion-readiness-report.json`, and
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PROVEN.md`; promotion later refreshes promotion-readiness
proof outputs.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

Minimum generated appendix rendered contents are aggregate proof verdict, exact
proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family
theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness
artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage
matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when evidence cannot be trusted.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture require deterministic generation,
source-safe output, current proof-source commit, and repair on stale or missing
artifact roots.

## Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

Validation commands include `check:v46-gate1`, `check:v46-gate2`,
`check:v46-gate3`, `check:v46-gate4`, `check:v46-gate5`, draft V46
spec-family checks, active V45 promoted checks, V45/V46 canon posture drift
checks, and later parity, proof, implementation, rehearsal, and promotion
commands.

## Appendix E. Current canonical source map

The current source map is active V45 canon with V46 draft target posture
prepared. Implementation source remains unversioned and is audited from V45
until a V46 parity gate authorizes specific implementation work.

## Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

Required subsystem coverage includes repo supply and depositing, reading and
measured demand, prompt/inference/evaluator ownership, deposit-to-read fit,
recall and ranking, verification decisions, selection and materialization,
branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence, identity, authority, signing, and
policy, sensitive data and confidentiality flows, projection, disclosure, and
redaction, proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay,
settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting, telemetry,
persistence, state, and failure semantics, host/runtime capability truth,
operator experience and pedagogy, validation and test stack, generated
artifacts and canonical promotion.

## Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

The V46 file family is `BITCODE_SPEC_V46.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V46_NOTES.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, future `BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PROVEN.md`, and
supporting Bitcode specifying files. Promotion may update `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`
only through the promotion gate.

## Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces include website routes, ChatGPT App, Bitcode Chat, API/MCP,
public docs, landing page, workflow checks, proof reports, and repair readback.
Quality contracts require accessible, source-safe, performant, replayable, and
operator-legible outputs.

## Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

Scenario coverage inherits auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export,
polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, and auth-many-asset-normalization.
Workflow coverage includes Targeted deposit and Normalization deposit across
patch and context branches and public, buyer, reviewer, and internal
principals. The contract remains Openly writable, Measurably readable,
Provable, and Valuable.

## Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

Fail closed on invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness,
parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial,
public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, stale promoted
status truth, missing proof readback, contradictory evidence, source leak,
wallet custody drift, or delivery mismatch.

## Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing AssetPack artifacts include `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`,
`.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`,
`.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`,
`.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-source-safe-e2e-rehearsal.json`,
`.bitcode/v46-promotion-readiness-report.json`, and
`BITCODE_SPEC_V46_PROVEN.md`. V46 requires protected source custody,
source-safe preview, entitlement-based unlock, and repository delivery receipt
before Reader-visible source.
