- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V42`

## Version executive summary

V43 turns the reliable V42 MVP path into the product shape Bitcode should expose to enterprise users. The transitional `/terminal` cockpit is split into `/read` and `/deposit`, and `/exchange` becomes `/packs`.

The V43 product object is AssetPacks in and AssetPacks out:

- `/deposit` helps an enterprise turn connected source into reviewable deposit AssetPack options before Depository admission.
- `/read` lets an enterprise request a Read, review the synthesized Need, request Finding Fits, preview source-safe AssetPack measurements, settle in BTC/BTD, and receive repository delivery.
- `/packs` is the searchable master-detail activity surface for all pack activity: deposit options, admitted Depository AssetPacks, Finding Fits previews, settled Need-Fit AssetPacks, quotes, rights transfers, compensation, delivery, proofs, and repair states.

V43 is also a UX correction version. Outside public documentation, the product should not lean on self-referential explanatory copy to compensate for unclear flows. The core routes, names, layout, progressive detail, rich execution log rows, and reusable themed components must make Depositing, Reading, and pack activity legible by default and deeply inspectable on demand.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode remains the knowledge commoditization protocol: deposits become source-safe Depository supply, Reading synthesizes a Need, Finding Fits searches many deposits, AssetPack synthesis creates a source-safe preview and withheld source bundle, BTC settlement transfers BTD read rights, and repository delivery unlocks only after paid settlement.

V43 changes the product routes and deposit-side synthesis experience around that law. It does not weaken V42 source-safety, BTD ownership, BTC settlement, source-to-shares compensation, ledger/database/object-storage synchronization, prompt/inference redaction, or post-settlement delivery boundaries.

## V43 source-of-truth hierarchy

`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to `V42` while V43 is draft.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V42.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PROVEN.md` are active canon.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V43.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_PARITY_MATRIX.md` define the draft target only on `version/v43` and `v43/gate-*` branches.
Implementation remains unversioned in source paths; route, package, component, test, prompt, and script names move in place as the single current Bitcode system.

## V43 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

Every V43 change must be reconstructable from specification, code, generated artifacts, tests, telemetry, and operator documentation. Route migration cannot be a cosmetic rename. Each gate must state product path, protocol object ownership, route/API/storage contracts, telemetry rows, proof roots, source-safe disclosure tier, and validation commands.

The route split must preserve V42 behavior while making it easier to use:

- `/read` owns Reading state and can still expose full proof detail.
- `/deposit` owns depositor source connection, option synthesis, review, approval, and Depository admission.
- `/packs` owns historical/current activity search and detailed inspection.

## V43 totality and precision enforcement rule

V43 must remove overlapping vocabulary. Exchange is not a current route name after V43 migration; the route and component prefix is Packs. Terminal is no longer the default product route for Reading or Depositing after V43 migration; it may remain only as an internal/debug cockpit if explicitly retained and renamed as such.

No product UI may reveal protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, raw provider responses, protected prompt payloads, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, or credentials. No route rename may create a second authority path that bypasses Need review, Finding Fits, BTC settlement, BTD rights transfer, or repository delivery reconciliation.

## V43 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- Rename `/exchange` to `/packs` across routes, component prefixes, docs, tests, telemetry labels, and operator vocabulary.
- Split `/terminal` into `/read` and `/deposit` as the default enterprise paths.
- Make `/packs` a dense, searchable, sortable, filterable master-detail activity surface for AssetPacks in and out.
- Add an agentic deposit-side flow that synthesizes deposit AssetPack options from connected source, depositor instructions, Depository state, and Reading demand.
- Let depositors review source-safe measurements, likely demand, sub-criticality, ROI posture, BTD potential, and compensation route before approving Depository admission.
- Improve UX so default flows are simple, self-explanatory, and visually polished while expandable detail preserves all Bitcode proof power.

Non-goals:

- V43 does not make unpaid source visible to readers.
- V43 does not mint BTD for speculative deposit options without a later paid Need-Fit.
- V43 does not weaken V42 settlement, rights, delivery, or source-to-shares law.
- V43 does not move advanced conversational overlays into the core default path unless a gate explicitly owns that work.

Design principles: AssetPacks in and out, route names as protocol truth, source-safe preview, proof-on-expand, purchase-before-source, depositor ROI clarity, and excellent enterprise usability.

## V43 system architecture and layer boundaries

V43 acts through existing layers:

- website routes and route-owned state for `/packs`, `/read`, and `/deposit`;
- package-owned protocol, BTD, pipeline, prompt, tool, storage, telemetry, and proof primitives;
- ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis and ReadFitsFindingSynthesis for Reading;
- a new deposit-side AssetPack option synthesis pipeline for connected-source supply creation;
- Depository search, demand/read activity indexing, source criticality policy, ROI posture, compensation preview, and admission proof;
- ledger/database/object-storage synchronization, source-safe telemetry rows, and generated artifacts.

Demonstration code remains self-contained inside `protocol-demonstration/`.

## V43 canonical domain model

V43 adds or promotes these product objects: PackActivity, PacksMasterFilter, PacksActivityDetail, DepositAssetPackOption, DepositOptionSynthesisRequest, DepositorInstruction, SourceCriticalityDecision, DemandSignalSummary, PositiveRoiPosture, DepositOptionReviewDecision, DepositOptionAdmissionReceipt, ReadRouteSession, ReadNeedReviewState, PackSettlementSummary, PackCompensationSummary, and PackRepairState.

These bind to existing Bitcode objects: Depository records, Read Requests, synthesized Needs, candidate fit deposits, selected fit sets, AssetPack previews, BTD/BTC quotes, settlement observations, rights receipts, source-to-shares rows, repository delivery receipts, execution telemetry, and proof artifacts.

## V43 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V43 operator chain is: connect source, synthesize deposit AssetPack options, review source-safe option measurements and demand posture, approve or reject Depository admission, request a Read, review or resynthesize Need, request Finding Fits, search many Depository AssetPacks, synthesize source-safe Need-Fit AssetPack preview, quote BTC/BTD purchase terms, settle BTC, transfer BTD rights, unlock full AssetPack delivery, create repository pull request, compensate contributors, synchronize ledger/database/storage, and inspect all activity through `/packs`.

## V43 Gate 1 Packs, Read, Deposit Roadmap And Spec Opening

Gate 1 opens the V43 specification family, branch posture, workflow posture, checker, roadmap, docs, and route vocabulary. It does not rename routes or implement pipelines. It closes when active V42 / draft V43 truth is visible in docs and workflows, V43 has a precise gate plan, and acceptance criteria explicitly include the latest UX/product instructions.

## V43 Gate 2 Route Vocabulary Inventory And Migration Plan

Gate 2 must inventory every `/exchange`, Exchange, `/terminal`, Terminal, Reading, Depositing, and pack-activity route/component/test/doc/API/telemetry reference. It must produce a migration matrix for Packs, Read, Deposit, retained debug cockpit surfaces, redirects, compatibility boundaries, and removal of self-referential product copy.

## V43 Gate 3 Packs Activity Master-Detail Data Model

Gate 3 must implement PackActivity data contracts, route APIs, table search, column sort, filtering, detail projection, source-safe metadata expansion, proof-root display, settlement/compensation/delivery/repair state readback, and no-source leak tests.

## V43 Gate 4 Read Route Extraction And Five-Step UX

Gate 4 must move the Reading default experience into `/read`: request read, review synthesized Need, request Finding Fits, review source-safe AssetPack preview, and settle/buy/deliver. It must preserve V42 telemetry, execution log streaming, proof expansion, retry/restart, and failure repair.

## V43 Gate 5 Deposit Route And Agentic AssetPack Option Synthesis

Gate 5 must move the Depositing default experience into `/deposit` and introduce the deposit AssetPack option synthesis pipeline. The pipeline must use connected source, depositor instructions, Depository state, and Reading demand to propose multiple source-safe AssetPack options for review.

## V43 Gate 6 Source Criticality, Demand, ROI, And Compensation Policy

Gate 6 must formalize how Bitcode estimates sub-critical source posture, likely demand, positive ROI, BTD potential, compensation route, and admission blockers. The system must help depositors sell non-critical positive-ROI IP while refusing or warning on critical IP and negative expected value.

## V43 Gate 7 Deposit Option Review, Approval, And Admission

Gate 7 must implement option accept/reject/resynthesize decisions, admission receipts, Depository indexing, storage projection, compensation preview, telemetry, and `/packs` activity synchronization for approved deposit AssetPacks.

## V43 Gate 8 UX/UI Product Excellence Pass

Gate 8 must improve route layout, visual hierarchy, copy, progressive disclosure, execution stream usage, empty/error/loading states, keyboard/responsive behavior, and reusable themed components across `/packs`, `/read`, and `/deposit`. It must remove in-app self-referential explanatory copy outside public docs.

## V43 Gate 9 Cross-Route Rehearsal, Telemetry, And Repair

Gate 9 must rehearse the full path across `/deposit`, `/read`, and `/packs`: synthesize deposit options, admit a deposit AssetPack, request Reading, find fits, preview, settle, deliver, compensate, and inspect activity. It must cover local/staging-testnet lanes, telemetry, database/ledger/storage synchronization, and repair states.

## V43 Gate 10 Promotion Readiness

Gate 10 must bind every V43 artifact, workflow, generated proof, docs update, route migration, source-safety proof, test suite, and active V43 / draft V44 runtime posture before canonical promotion.

## V43 canonical subsystem surfaces

### Depositing and asset supply

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: DepositAssetPackOption, DepositOptionSynthesisRequest, Depository record, source admission proof, compensation preview, `.bitcode/v43-deposit-options.json`.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: connected-source scan, depositor instruction parsing, source criticality evaluation, demand signal matching, option grouping, measurement projection, and admission proof.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: invalid deposit, missing authority, critical-source warning, negative ROI blocker, source projection mismatch, and protected-source leak.
- Current proof obligations: source-safe option synthesis, review decision provenance, Depository admission, compensation preview, and activity synchronization.

### Reading and prompt/inference ownership

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: ReadRouteSession, Read Request, synthesized Need, Need review decision, Finding Fits request, AssetPack preview, quote, settlement, delivery.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis and ReadFitsFindingSynthesis remain the Reading pipelines, with Need review gating Finding Fits.

- Current proof obligations: source-safe telemetry, prompt/program receipts, parser outputs, stage persistence, and repair states.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: `/read`, Reading APIs, pipeline host, prompt registries, execution stream, ledger/database/storage adapters.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: `pnpm run check:v43-gate4`, uapi tests, pipeline tests, browser proof.
- Current accepted boundaries: `/read` is the default user path; retained debug cockpit cannot bypass it.

### Fit, recall, ranking, and verification

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: query plan, candidate fit deposits, ranking receipts, selected fit set, proof roots, search receipts.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: depository-wide many-fit search uses embeddings, metadata, measurements, provider search, and verifier ranking.

- Current validating commands and parity basis: `pnpm run check:v43-gate4`, `pnpm run check:v43-gate9`, pipeline integration.
- Current accepted boundaries: fit deposits remain source-safe until settlement unlock.

### Selection and materialization

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: AssetPack preview, withheld source bundle, delivery receipt, repository pull request, PackActivity.

- Current source-bearing implementation basis: auth adapters, policy packages, wallet/BTD packages, API middleware.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: unit/API tests, V40 integration tests, V43 route tests.
- Current accepted boundaries: no route owns private key material or cross-org source visibility.

### Disclosure and projection

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: source-safe projection, preview metadata, expanded proof metadata, redaction receipt, PackActivity detail.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: disclosure tiers separate public, user-visible, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, and operator-only data.

- Current proof obligations: redaction tests, source-safe artifacts, UI collapsed/expanded disclosure contract.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: route serializers, UI components, telemetry redactors, proof generators.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: leak scans, uapi tests, browser screenshots, generated reports.
- Current accepted boundaries: public docs may explain; product UI must disclose only operationally necessary source-safe data.

### Settlement and exact accounting

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: quote, BTC payment observation, finality, BTD rights transfer, source-to-shares allocation, compensation receipt.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: deterministic quote uses measurement weight, measurement volume, and protocol fee allocation; source-to-shares uses exact accounting.

- Current proof obligations: BTC fee conservation, BTD rights receipt, compensation route, ledger/database/storage reconciliation.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: BTD package, ledger writers, settlement observers, repair jobs.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: BTD tests, route tests, rehearsal artifacts.

- Current proof obligations: proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: scripts, protocol package generators, workflow checks, test suites.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: `pnpm run check:v43-gate1`, later gate checks, promotion readiness.
- Current accepted boundaries: proof artifacts never serialize secrets or protected source.

## V43 generated canon

### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

Inherited reproducibility remains binding.

### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

Inherited operator-quality truth remains binding.

### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| artifact | owner | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v43-spec-family-report.json` | spec family | draft-required |
| `.bitcode/v43-canonical-input-report.json` | canonical inputs | draft-required |

### V43 specifying generated artifacts

V43 starts with `.bitcode/v43-spec-family-report.json` and `.bitcode/v43-canonical-input-report.json`; later gates add route, pack, deposit, read, UX, rehearsal, and promotion artifacts.

### Shared generated-artifact fields

All artifacts include version, schema id, generatedAt, sourceSafetyVerdict, evidence roots, validationCommands, and aggregate proof verdict.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

V43 artifacts add route ids, pack activity ids, deposit option ids, review decisions, measurement roots, quote roots, settlement roots, delivery roots, and repair roots.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

Artifacts classify fields as public, user-visible, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, operator-only, and withheld. They fail closed when protected source, raw prompt, raw provider response, credentials, wallet private material, or unpaid AssetPack source appears in source-safe tiers.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The V43 generated appendix must render aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when required evidence is stale or unsafe.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Generation and check commands must be deterministic. Any stale artifact, missing witness, stale promoted status truth, or leak-shaped value fails closed.

## V43 validation canon

Gate 1 validates with `pnpm run check:v43-gate1`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V43 --mode draft --current-target V42`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V42`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V42 --draft-target V43`, and `git diff --check`.

## V43 promotion canon

V43 promotion must occur only after every gate is implemented, specified, tested, documented, source-safe, rehearsed, and green through maintained workflows. Promotion must create `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_PROVEN.md` and advance `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` to `V43`.

## V43 appendices and canonical supporting material

The appendices below make V43 auditable before implementation.

## Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Canonical types include PackActivity, PacksActivityDetail, DepositAssetPackOption, DepositOptionSynthesisRequest, SourceCriticalityDecision, DemandSignalSummary, PositiveRoiPosture, DepositOptionReviewDecision, ReadRouteSession, PackSettlementSummary, PackCompensationSummary, and PackRepairState.

## Appendix B. Proof family closure catalog

The proof family closure catalog binds the families above to route, pipeline, storage, ledger, telemetry, and generated proof obligations.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Regeneration commands must be deterministic.

## Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

Gate checks are `check:v43-gate1` through later V43 gate checks.

## Appendix E. Current canonical source map

V43 source work starts from V42 active canon, package protocol state, website route implementations, pipeline packages, BTD packages, and generated proof scripts.

## Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

V43 must cover repo supply and depositing; reading and measured demand; prompt/inference/evaluator ownership; deposit-to-read fit; recall and ranking; verification decisions; selection and materialization; branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence; identity, authority, signing, and policy; sensitive data and confidentiality flows; projection, disclosure, and redaction; proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay; settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting; telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics; host/runtime capability truth; operator experience and pedagogy; validation and test stack; generated artifacts and canonical promotion.

## Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

V43 files are `BITCODE_SPEC_V43.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and later `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_PROVEN.md`.

## Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces are `/packs`, `/read`, `/deposit`, retained internal/debug cockpit if any, rich execution stream rows, settlement panels, compensation panels, proof expansion, and repair views.

## Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

Scenarios include auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch, context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, and Valuable.

## Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

V43 fails closed on invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, and stale promoted status truth.

## Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing artifacts include `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_PROVEN.md`.

## V43 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

V43 may reopen route names, product state, pack activity, deposit option synthesis, UX layout, and proof surfaces. It may not reopen BTD supply law, BTC settlement conservation, source-to-shares accounting, source-safe disclosure, or demonstration/commercial boundary rules without an explicit later canon.

## V43 completion condition

V43 completes when `/packs`, `/read`, and `/deposit` are the default product paths; agentic deposit AssetPack option synthesis is specified and implemented; pack activity is searchable and inspectable; Reading remains settlement-gated and source-safe; UX is self-explanatory and polished; local/staging rehearsal proves the full cross-route path; and promotion readiness advances Bitcode to active V43 / draft V44.
