# Bitcode Spec V38 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V38`
- V38 state: active draft opening over promoted V37
- Current canonical/latest target: `V37`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V37.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V37_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: draft `.bitcode/v38-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-inference-surface-inventory.json`, `.bitcode/v38-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.json`, `.bitcode/v38-prompt-benchmark-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-disclosure-boundary-report.json`, `.bitcode/v38-read-need-comprehension-inference-hardening.json`, `.bitcode/v38-read-fits-finding-search-embeddings.json`, `.bitcode/v38-assetpack-synthesis-economic-traceability.json`, `.bitcode/v38-conversation-tool-prompt-inference-parity.json`, `.bitcode/v38-local-staging-inference-depository-search-rehearsal.json`, V38 gate-quality workflow evidence, and future V38 generated proof artifacts as gates close

- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V38.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_PROVEN.md` only after V38 promotion
- Scope: V38 parity ledger for inference stack correctness, prompt and PromptPart benchmarking, Reading pipeline inference, depository fit-finding, tool prompt definitions, telemetry, rehearsal, and promotion readiness over promoted V37 Website Conversations canon

## Purpose

The V38 parity matrix prevents Bitcode inference from becoming hidden prompt folklore, direct provider-call drift, one-off search code, or telemetry that cannot be audited.
Every V38 gate must name the primitive stack it uses, source evidence, generated artifacts, tests, prompt identities, disclosure tiers, depository-search channels, typed outputs, proof roots, and fail-closed repair posture.

## Gate 10 Local staging inference and depository search rehearsal closure

| Area | Required result | Judgment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local lane | The local Vercel Sandbox harness loads only untracked local env files, requires explicit live opt-in, requires sandbox authentication, redacts known secrets, and writes local artifacts under `.bitcode/pipeline-harness-runs` | closed |
| Staging-testnet lane | The staging route preflight requires bounded real inference when strictness is active, validates Supabase REST readback, streams to database storage, and returns source-safe completion summaries | closed |
| Reading pipeline rehearsal | ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis and ReadFitsFindingSynthesis run through the harness with accepted Need state, Failsafe/Thricified telemetry, prompt/output presence flags, and typed output shapes | closed |
| Depository search rehearsal | Finding Fits rehearses many-candidate recall across lexical, symbolic, path, metadata, measurement, embedding-vector, and provider-specific channels with active embedding policy and selected-fit provenance | closed |

## accepted boundaries

- V38 draft work may specify and implement inference stack, prompt benchmarking, Reading search, telemetry, rehearsal, and promotion-readiness surfaces.
- V38 draft work may not change BTD supply law, production-mainnet admission, route versioning discipline, settlement finality law, or source visibility rights without a later explicit promoted canon.
- V38 parity rows begin as drafted during Gate 1 and must become closed only as each gate's source, tests, generated artifacts, and workflow evidence land.
