## Version executive summary

V41 exists because V38 made the inference call stack correct and V40 made testing and benchmark lanes reliable enough to treat prompts as executable programs.
The version must examine every raw PromptPart, every composed Prompt, every registry binding, every interpolation variable, every benchmark fixture, every inference callsite, every parsed return type, and every source-safe telemetry projection that participates in Bitcode inference.

V41 prioritizes the Reading pipelines: `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis`.
Those pipelines decide whether Bitcode understands a Read Request, whether many Depository fits can be found, whether selected fits support a source-safe AssetPack preview, and whether post-settlement delivery may reveal source-bearing AssetPack content.
Prompt changes must improve that behavior without weakening BTC settlement, BTD rights transfer, source-to-shares accounting, disclosure boundaries, or source-safe telemetry.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode remains the protocol and commercial system for depositing technical knowledge, reading needs against the Depository, finding many fitting deposits, synthesizing source-safe AssetPack previews, settling BTC fees, transferring BTD rights, and delivering full source-bearing AssetPacks only after settlement.
V41 changes prompt-program quality, not economic law.
Every prompt rewrite must preserve the buyer, reviewer, public, internal, and operator visibility tiers that prevent secrets, protected source, raw provider responses, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, and unpaid AssetPack source from leaking.

## V41 source-of-truth hierarchy

`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to `V40` while V41 is draft.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V40.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V40_PROVEN.md` are active canon.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V41.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V41_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V41_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V41_PARITY_MATRIX.md` define the draft target only on `version/v41` and `v41/gate-*` branches.
Implementation remains unversioned in source paths; prompt registries, prompt parts, prompt titles, tests, scripts, packages, and components must move in place as the single current Bitcode system.

## V41 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

Prompt-program work is not copywriting.
Each prompt and PromptPart must be re-implementable from its catalogue row: semantic purpose, registry path, composed prompt memberships, interpolation inputs, execution context ancestry, inference chain position, expected type, parser, benchmark fixtures, source-safe telemetry shape, allowed disclosure tier, failure behavior, and validating command.
The spec, artifacts, tests, and code must let a future engineer rebuild the prompt stack without using conversation history.

## V41 totality and precision enforcement rule

V41 must make prompt totality enumerable.
No prompt or PromptPart may be rewritten unless it is inventoried, benchmarked, tied to an inference callsite, and checked against the parsed return type it is supposed to produce.
No inferred output may be accepted when its prompt registry binding, context interpolation, or type-parser result is missing.
No generated report may serialize raw protected prompt text, protected PromptPart source, raw provider response, secrets, wallet material, private settlement payloads, protected source, or unpaid AssetPack source.

## V41 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- Catalogue every raw PromptPart and every composed Prompt across Reading, Conversation, tool-definition, and interface inference surfaces.
- Benchmark PromptParts and Prompts as source-safe programs with deterministic smoke, focused, and promotion lanes.
- Audit registry composition from phase to PTRR agent to PTRR step to FailsafeGenerationSequence to ThricifiedGeneration.
- Audit interpolation contracts, execution ancestry context, prompt templates, parser targets, and parsed return types.
- Repartition PromptParts into meaningfully benchmarkable semantic units where current divisions hide testable purpose.
- Rewrite, retitle, or merge PromptParts and Prompts only after catalogue and benchmark evidence supports the change.
- Harden `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` before Conversation and other inference prompts.

Non-goals:

- V41 does not alter BTC fee law, BTD ownership law, source-to-shares compensation, or post-settlement delivery rights.
- V41 does not introduce versioned source routes.
- V41 does not expose protected prompt payloads or unpaid AssetPack source for benchmark convenience.
- V41 does not reopen V40 testing gates unless prompt work reveals a concrete regression.

Design principles: prompts as programs, semantic parts, benchmarkable changes, registry truth, typed outputs, source-safe observability, and commercial Reading excellence.

## V41 system architecture and layer boundaries

V41 acts through existing layers:

- prompt and PromptPart primitives;
- prompt registries, phase registries, agent registries, tool registries, and execution registries;
- PTRR agents, FailsafeGenerationSequence, ThricifiedGeneration, and structured parser outputs;
- `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis`;
- Conversation, tool-definition, Terminal, and interface inference surfaces;
- benchmark, telemetry, route, storage, and proof artifacts.

The demonstration directory remains a standalone minimal witness.
Commercial code must not import demonstration code.
Demonstration prompt examples may be updated only inside `protocol-demonstration/` and may not depend on commercial prompt packages.

## V41 canonical domain model

V41 prompt-program domain objects are PromptPart, Prompt, Prompt registry entry, PromptPart registry entry, interpolation variable, composed prompt chain, execution ancestry frame, inference callsite, FailsafeGenerationSequence receipt, ThricifiedGeneration receipt, tool definition prompt, parser target, parsed return envelope, benchmark fixture, benchmark run, prompt quality verdict, rewrite plan, disclosure posture, and generated prompt-program proof artifact.
These objects bind to existing Bitcode objects: deposits, Depository search documents, Read Requests, synthesized Needs, accepted Need admission, candidate fit deposits, selected fits, AssetPack previews, quotes, BTC settlement observations, BTD rights transfer, delivery locks, telemetry, and repair actions.

## V41 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V41 operator chain is: open prompt catalogue, locate every prompt/PromptPart, map registry composition, map callsites and type parsers, build source-safe fixtures, run benchmark baselines, propose semantic repartition, rewrite only admitted prompts, rerun benchmarks, verify pipeline and interface behavior, inspect telemetry redaction, regenerate reports, and promote only when prompt-program artifacts prove the whole stack.

## V41 Gate 1 Prompt Program Roadmap And Spec Opening

Gate 1 opens the V41 spec family, branch posture, workflow posture, checker, roadmap, docs, and proof vocabulary.
It does not rewrite prompt content.
It closes when active V40 / draft V41 truth is visible in the root docs, protocol docs, workflow checks, package scripts, and roadmap, and when V41 has a precise gate plan.

## V41 Gate 2 PromptPart And Prompt Inventory Catalog

Gate 2 must emit a source-safe inventory of every raw PromptPart and every composed Prompt.
Rows must include prompt id, part id, source root, registry owner, semantic purpose, prompt family, composed prompt membership, current title, template variable names, benchmark fixture ids, disclosure tier, and validation command.
The artifact may include ids, hashes, counts, and source-safe previews, but no raw protected prompt text.
Gate 2 is closed by the package-backed `buildV41PromptPartPromptInventory` source, deterministic `.bitcode/v41-promptpart-prompt-inventory.json` artifact, `generate:v41-prompt-inventory`, `check:v41-prompt-inventory`, `check:v41-gate2`, protocol tests, and gate/canon workflow wiring.
The current inventory source-safe count contract is 1,459 raw PromptPart rows, 105 composed Prompt rows, 59 generic PromptPart rows, 1,400 specific PromptPart rows, 49 Reading prompt rows, 2 Conversation prompt rows, 74 tool prompt rows, 10 interface prompt rows, 87 prompt rows with registry paths, 1,135 registry paths, 8 benchmark fixture families, V38 benchmark report binding, and V40 prompt benchmark smoke binding.
Gate 2 also preserves V41 scope and prepares draft V42 only as forward roadmap truth: V42 will focus on shortest-path Depositing, shortest-path Reading, and an AI-reading dominant demonstration MVP.

## V41 Gate 3 Registry Composition And Interpolation Contracts

Gate 3 must prove the composition chain from phase and pipeline context through PTRR agents, PTRR steps, FailsafeGenerationSequence, and ThricifiedGeneration final prompt resolution.

The current source-safe baseline covers 10 rows, 120 passing source predicates, all five Reading UX steps, both Reading pipeline ids, Gate 2 PromptPart/Prompt inventory roots, Gate 3 registry/interpolation roots, V38 benchmark fixture roots, V40 prompt smoke roots, 36 parser target ids, 9 registry contract ids, deterministic baseline scores, and source-safe disclosure tiers.
The artifact may include ids, hashes, counts, fixture ids, metric ids, parser target ids, baseline scores, source path roots, and verdicts, but no raw prompt text, interpolated prompts, raw provider responses, protected source, private context, credentials, or unpaid AssetPack source.

## V41 Gate 5 ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis Prompt Rewrite And Return-Type Hardening

Gate 5 may repartition, retitle, and rewrite ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis PromptParts and Prompts after Gate 2 through Gate 4 evidence exists.

The artifact may include ids, source hashes, counts, prompt surface ids, parser target ids, fixture ids, predicate verdicts, dependency roots, and redaction posture, but no raw prompt text, interpolated prompts, raw provider responses, protected source, private context, credentials, or unpaid AssetPack source.

## V41 Gate 6 ReadFitsFindingSynthesis Prompt Rewrite Search And AssetPack Context Hardening

Gate 6 may repartition, retitle, and rewrite ReadFitsFindingSynthesis PromptParts and Prompts after Gate 2 through Gate 4 evidence exists.

The artifact may include ids, source hashes, counts, prompt surface ids, parser target ids, fixture ids, predicate verdicts, dependency roots, query/ranking/provenance root metadata, and redaction posture, but no raw prompt text, interpolated prompts, raw provider responses, protected source, private context, credentials, settlement private payloads, wallet private material, or unpaid AssetPack source.

## V41 Gate 7 Conversation Tool And Interface Prompt Rewrite

Gate 7 applies the same prompt-program discipline to Conversation, tool-definition, MCP API, ChatGPT App, public API, Terminal summaries, and interface prompts.
It must preserve route authority, source selection policy, rich stream log disclosure, tool schemas, and parsed return types.
Gate 7 is closed by the package-backed `buildV41ConversationToolInterfacePromptRewrite` source, deterministic `.bitcode/v41-conversation-tool-interface-prompt-rewrite.json` artifact, `generate:v41-conversation-tool-interface-prompt-rewrite`, `check:v41-conversation-tool-interface-prompt-rewrite`, `check:v41-gate7`, protocol tests, focused prompt-part rewrites, and gate/canon workflow wiring.

## V41 Gate 8 Prompt Benchmark Report And Telemetry Integration

Gate 8 must emit source-safe benchmark and telemetry artifacts after prompt rewrites.
It binds benchmark deltas, prompt lineage, prompt registry versions, inference receipts, Failsafe and Thricified receipts, parsed outputs, redaction posture, and repair hooks without serializing raw provider responses or protected prompts.
Gate 8 is closed by the package-backed `buildV41PromptProgramBenchmarkReport` source, deterministic `.bitcode/v41-prompt-program-benchmark-report.json` artifact, `generate:v41-prompt-program-benchmark-report`, `check:v41-prompt-program-benchmark-report`, `check:v41-gate8`, protocol tests, and gate/canon workflow wiring.

Current proof obligations: generated artifacts, tests, and promotion checks must prove no prompt surface is omitted.
Current source-bearing implementation basis: protocol canonical generators, prompt packages, benchmark scripts, and workflow checks.

## V41 generated canon

### Appendix C. Generated artifact contract catalog

#### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

V41 preserves reproducible-canon expectations for replay, hashes, generated artifact inventories, and proof-source commit recording.

#### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

V41 preserves operator-quality expectations for visual, accessibility, performance, projection, and quality summaries where prompt changes affect product surfaces.

#### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| Artifact | Purpose | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v41-spec-family-report.json` | spec-family structural report | Gate 1 |
| `.bitcode/v41-canonical-input-report.json` | canonical input report | Gate 1 |
| `.bitcode/v41-promptpart-prompt-inventory.json` | PromptPart and Prompt inventory | Gate 2 |
| `.bitcode/v41-registry-interpolation-contracts.json` | registry and interpolation contract report | Gate 3 |
| `.bitcode/v41-reading-prompt-benchmark-baselines.json` | Reading benchmark baseline report | Gate 4 |
| `.bitcode/v41-readneed-prompt-hardening.json` | ReadNeed prompt rewrite report | Gate 5 |
| `.bitcode/v41-readfitsfinding-prompt-hardening.json` | ReadFitsFinding prompt rewrite report | Gate 6 |
| `.bitcode/v41-conversation-tool-interface-prompt-rewrite.json` | Conversation, tool, and interface prompt rewrite report | Gate 7 |
| `.bitcode/v41-prompt-program-benchmark-report.json` | post-rewrite benchmark and telemetry report | Gate 8 |
| `.bitcode/v41-promotion-readiness-report.json` | V41 promotion readiness report | Gate 9 |

#### V41 specifying generated artifacts

The minimum V41 specifying generated artifacts are `.bitcode/v41-spec-family-report.json` and `.bitcode/v41-canonical-input-report.json`.
Later V41 gates add prompt-program artifacts after their source-safe generators exist.

#### Shared generated-artifact fields

All V41 generated artifacts must carry aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when source-safety or completeness checks fail.

#### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Prompt artifacts may carry prompt ids, PromptPart ids, hashes, semantic labels, registry ids, callsite ids, parser ids, benchmark fixture ids, scores, verdicts, and disclosure tiers.
They may not carry raw protected prompt text.

#### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

Allowed public fields are ids, counts, hashes, redacted summaries, verdicts, command ids, and proof roots.
Protected fields are raw prompt payloads, raw PromptPart source, raw provider responses, private context, protected source, secrets, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, and unpaid AssetPack source.

#### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The generated appendix must render prompt-program gate results, source-safe artifact summaries, proof-family closure, command evidence, and promotion posture.

#### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Generation must fail closed when artifact freshness, source-safety, benchmark completeness, parser typing, or promoted status truth drifts.

## V41 validation canon

### Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

V41 Gate 1 validates with `pnpm run check:v41-gate1`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V41 --mode draft --current-target V40`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V40 --draft-target V41`, and `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V40`.
V41 Gate 2 validates with `pnpm run generate:v41-prompt-inventory`, `pnpm run check:v41-prompt-inventory`, `pnpm run check:v41-gate2`, and `node --test --test-force-exit packages/protocol/test/v41-promptpart-prompt-inventory.test.js`.
V41 Gate 3 validates with `pnpm run generate:v41-registry-interpolation-contracts`, `pnpm run check:v41-registry-interpolation-contracts`, `pnpm run check:v41-gate3`, and `node --test --test-force-exit packages/protocol/test/v41-registry-interpolation-contracts.test.js`.
Later gates add focused generator, checker, package, benchmark, and workflow commands.

## V41 promotion canon

### Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

V41 promotion will be a version-branch PR into `main`.
The promotion workflow must validate every V41 gate, generate `BITCODE_SPEC_V41_PROVEN.md`, prepare active V41 / draft V42 runtime posture, and update `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` only after checks pass.

## V41 appendices and canonical supporting material

### Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Canonical prompt-program types include PromptPart, Prompt, registry entry, interpolation contract, FailsafeGenerationSequence receipt, ThricifiedGeneration receipt, parser target, parsed return envelope, benchmark fixture, benchmark result, rewrite plan, telemetry projection, and proof artifact.

### Appendix B. Proof family closure catalog

The exact proof-family inventory matrix above is normative for V41.
Each proof family must map prompt-program objects to artifacts, commands, and fail-closed checks.

### Appendix E. Current canonical source map

Current source-bearing prompt work lives in `packages/prompts`, `packages/generic-agents`, `packages/agent-generics`, `packages/tools-generics`, `packages/pipelines/asset-pack`, `uapi`, `packages/protocol`, and benchmark scripts.
Demonstration-only prompt examples live only under `protocol-demonstration/`.

### Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

| Subsystem or concern | Current canonical contracts or artifacts | Current closure basis | Generated/runtime evidence | Validating commands | Accepted boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| repo supply and depositing | source-safe prompt metadata | V41 catalogue | prompt inventory | check:v41-gate2 | protected source withheld |

| settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting | quote explanation prompts | V41 Gate 6 | BTD checks | check:v41-gate6 | no law change |
| telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics | rich stream prompt metadata | V41 Gate 8 | telemetry rows | check:v41-gate8 | no raw responses |
| host/runtime capability truth | benchmark lanes | V41 Gate 4 | run receipts | check:v41-gate4 | opt-in live lanes |
| operator experience and pedagogy | prompt report docs | V41 Gate 8 | docs/readback | check:v41-gate8 | source-safe summaries |

| generated artifacts and canonical promotion | V41 artifact family | V41 Gate 9 | promotion report | check:v41-gate9 | no stale status truth |

### Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operators must be able to run prompt inventory, benchmark baseline, rewrite validation, and promotion readiness commands locally without tracked credentials.
Live provider benchmarks and staging-testnet prompt rehearsals require explicit opt-in and environment checks.

### Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

V41 scenario classes include auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch, context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, and Valuable.
Each scenario must specify the principal visibility tier, source-safe prompt context, benchmark fixture, expected parsed type, telemetry projection, and settlement/disclosure boundary.

### Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

Fail-closed triggers include invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, stale promoted status truth, missing benchmark fixture, missing prompt registry edge, unknown interpolation variable, parser mismatch, and raw protected payload serialization.

### Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

V41 prompt work must preserve `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V41_PROVEN.md` as source-bearing or proof-bearing artifact contract references.
Prompt outputs may describe AssetPack measurements, quote posture, fit provenance, and delivery state before settlement.
Prompt outputs may not expose source-bearing AssetPack content before BTC payment, finality, BTD rights transfer, and ledger/database/object-storage reconciliation agree.

## V41 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

V41 opens by specifying prompt-program work before changing prompt content.
If a later gate finds an unowned prompt, an untyped inference output, a hidden interpolation dependency, a benchmark that serializes protected content, or a Reading regression, the relevant earlier V41 gate must reopen.

## V41 completion condition

V41 closes when every PromptPart and Prompt is catalogued, benchmarked, semantically partitioned where useful, retitled or rewritten where evidence supports it, validated against registry composition and parsed return types, integrated into Reading and Conversation inference, proven source-safe in telemetry and artifacts, documented, tested, generated, workflow-checked, and promoted as active canon.
