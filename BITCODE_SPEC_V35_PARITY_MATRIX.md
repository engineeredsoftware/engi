# Bitcode Spec V35 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V35`
- V35 state: active draft target opened; parity tracks telemetry and documentation depth over promoted V34 canon
- Current canonical/latest target: `V34`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V34.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: draft `.bitcode/v35-spec-family-report.json`, draft `.bitcode/v35-canonical-input-report.json`, source-safe `.bitcode/v35-documentation-surface-catalog.json`, source-safe `.bitcode/v35-telemetry-taxonomy-catalog.json`, source-safe `.bitcode/v35-public-docs-usage-guides.json`, source-safe `.bitcode/v35-operator-runbook-catalog.json`, source-safe `.bitcode/v35-docs-qa-alignment-report.json`, source-safe `.bitcode/v35-testnet-rollout-readiness-guide.json`, future source-safe V35 telemetry/documentation artifacts, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V35_PROVEN.md` only after V35 promotion
- Source parity state: V35 opens source parity for telemetry taxonomy, documentation surfaces, public docs usage, dashboard/runbook, documentation QA, onboarding, integration, rehearsal, and promotion-readiness gates
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V35.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V35_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V35_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V35_PROVEN.md` only after V35 promotion
- Scope: V35 draft parity ledger for telemetry and documentation depth over promoted V34 deployment canon
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V34`

## Purpose

The V35 parity matrix prevents telemetry and documentation from becoming dashboard-only assumptions, stale docs, or operator folklore.
Every V35 gate must name the package-owned telemetry or documentation object, docs surface, event family, source-safety class, proof root, generated artifact, validation command, dashboard/runbook linkage, and fail-closed docs QA required for closure.

## Audit basis

## V35 accepted boundaries

- V35 owns telemetry and documentation depth, source-safe observability, documentation QA, dashboards, runbooks, incidents, onboarding, and rollout guides.
- V35 owns broad telemetry/documentation programs, dashboards, docs, incidents, operator guides, and rollout material.
- V36 owns deeper Exchange.
- V37 owns website Conversations.
- V35 does not authorize value-bearing production-mainnet launch.
- V35 does not expose protected AssetPack source before settlement through any runtime carrier, generated proof, log, or interface.

## V35 completion condition

V35 parity is complete when each telemetry/documentation gate row has source evidence, tests, generated artifacts where required, workflow/checker support, and closed parity judgment, and when V35 promotion can rewrite `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` from `V34` to `V35` only after promotion-grade validations pass.
