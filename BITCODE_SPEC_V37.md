## Version executive summary

V37 is the Website Conversations depth version.
It returns to the website conversation experience after Terminal, Reading, BTD, Auxillaries, Interfaces, Deployment, Telemetry/Docs, and Exchange depth have been canonically promoted.
V37 makes conversations a first-class product surface for enterprise users to draft requests, stream assistant work, select source context, move from conversational intent into Terminal transactions, and preserve route-local conversational history without creating a parallel Protocol law.

V37 closes only when Conversations can provide a low-friction, source-safe, proof-rooted user experience for chat, writing, source selection, stream telemetry, Terminal handoff, privacy, and recovery while reusing the promoted Protocol, Reading, BTD, Exchange, telemetry, and documentation contracts.

## V37 Conversations spine

V37 adds Website Conversations product contracts over inherited V36 canon:

- `ConversationSession`: route-local conversation identity, route-local history, user/account posture, source context, policy decision, stream state, and proof-rooted history references.
- `ConversationMessage`: user, assistant, system, tool, and handoff message records with source-safe disclosure classification, redaction posture, retry state, and telemetry event ids.
- `ConversationStreamEvent`: readable streaming rows for model deltas, tool calls, retrieval summaries, proof roots, retry states, completion decisions, and error rows.
- `ConversationWritingWorkspace`: fullscreen writing mode for drafting Read Requests, Need feedback, AssetPack review notes, and Terminal handoff summaries without source leakage.
- `ConversationSourceSelector`: repository, branch, commit, deposit, BTD range, AssetPack preview, document, and prior conversation source selectors governed by policy, rights, and disclosure posture.
- `ConversationTerminalHandoff`: source-safe handoff from conversation context into `/terminal` transactions for Depositing, Reading, Finding Fits, Exchange, settlement, and delivery workflows.
- `ConversationPersistencePrivacyRedaction`: durable conversation storage, visibility tier separation, export, delete, retention, replay, and incident repair posture for source-safe persisted history.
- `ConversationTelemetryProofHooks`: source-safe telemetry families, dashboard panels, runbook ids, correlation ids, proof roots, redaction posture, and visibility tiers for sessions, messages, streams, tools, selectors, handoffs, retries, errors, and completions.

V37 does not replace the V28 ChatGPT App, V33 interface contracts, V35 telemetry/docs, or V36 Exchange law.
It turns the website conversation surface into a route-owned user experience that consumes those contracts and emits proof-rooted source-safe telemetry.

## V37 Gate 1 Conversations Roadmap canon

Gate 1 opens V37 correctly:

- V37 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY files exist over active V36.
- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` remains `V36`.
- README, roadmap, PR template, package docs, demonstration docs, and workflows describe V36 active / V37 draft posture.
- `check:v37-gate1` validates branch naming, spec family, notes, parity, roadmap truth, workflow posture, Conversations vocabulary, and promotion boundaries.
- The V37 gate list is explicit before Conversations implementation begins.

## V37 Gate 2 ConversationSession route-history canon

Gate 2 implements `ConversationSession` route-local identity and history
contracts as package-owned source for Website Conversations.
`ConversationSession` owns route-local session identity, user/account posture,
source context reference, policy decision, stream state, history references,
proof roots, event ids, redaction posture, and persistence boundary.
It emits `.bitcode/v37-conversation-session-route-history.json` with
`source-safe-conversation-session-route-history-metadata`, deterministic row
roots, deterministic detail roots, route contract ids, required history
operation ids, source evidence roots, and source-safe disclosure limits.

The Gate 2 route-history coverage is create, restore, branch, retry, redact,
and stream. Route contracts cover `/api/conversations`,
`/api/conversations/[conversationId]`, `/api/conversations/stream`,
`/api/conversations/[conversationId]/stream`, `/api/conversations/branch`, and
the shared route redaction contract. Route-local history can restore a session,
branch a session, retry a stream, and apply redaction checkpoints without
becoming global ledger truth. Terminal and the ledger remain authoritative for
transactions, settlement, Exchange, wallet, and BTD ownership work.

Conversation route-history payloads may expose only source-safe conversation
identity, source-safe summaries, route contract metadata, account and policy
metadata, source context refs, stream state, history refs, proof roots, event
ids, and persistence boundaries. They must not expose protected source, raw
protected prompts, protected model responses with source, provider tokens,
wallet private material, secrets, settlement private payloads, unpaid AssetPack
source, or any claim that route-local Conversations are global ledger truth.
`check:v37-gate2` validates package source, generated artifact freshness,
package tests, route tests, docs, workflow wiring, source safety, proof roots,
event ids, route ids, history operations, and persistence boundaries.

## V37 Gate 3 ConversationStreamEvent stream UI canon

Gate 3 implements `ConversationStreamEvent` as the package-owned stream event
contract for Website Conversations. `ConversationStreamEvent` owns model
deltas, tool calls, retrieval summaries, proof roots, retry states, completion
decisions, and error rows. It emits
`.bitcode/v37-conversation-stream-event-contract.json` with
`source-safe-conversation-stream-event-metadata`, deterministic row roots,
deterministic detail roots, event kind ids, required telemetry fields, source
evidence roots, and source-safe disclosure limits.

Conversation stream events are carried on the unversioned conversation SSE
routes as metadata attached to legacy-compatible rows. The stream UI uses the
shared rich execution log surface: collapsed rows show readable stream status,
and expanded accordions show event ids, proof roots, redaction posture,
prompt-disclosure posture, result-disclosure posture, fail-closed states, and
source-safe expanded metadata. Raw protected prompts, protected source,
provider tokens, private wallet material, raw provider responses, settlement
private payloads, unpaid AssetPack source, and global ledger authority claims
are never valid stream UI payloads.

`check:v37-gate3` validates package source, generated artifact freshness,
package tests, route/UI tests, telemetry binding, docs, workflow wiring,
source safety, event kind coverage, proof roots, disclosure posture, and
fail-closed states.

## V37 Gate 4 ConversationWritingWorkspace writing canon

Gate 4 implements `ConversationWritingWorkspace` as the package-owned
fullscreen writing contract for Website Conversations. It owns Read Request,
Need feedback, AssetPack review note, and Terminal handoff summary drafting
modes. It emits `.bitcode/v37-conversation-writing-workspace.json` with
`source-safe-conversation-writing-workspace-metadata`, deterministic row roots,
deterministic detail roots, mode ids, action ids, required field ids, proof
roots, event ids, route-local draft keys, source evidence roots, and
source-safe disclosure limits.

Conversation writing state is route-local workspace state. It can be saved,
restored, summarized, and handed off from the fullscreen composer workspace.
Saved drafts may remain in route-local browser storage for recovery, but
summaries and handoff messages crossing the stream boundary are redacted
source-safe metadata. Protected source, raw protected prompts, provider
tokens, wallet private material, settlement private payloads, unpaid AssetPack
source, and global ledger authority claims are never valid emitted workspace
payloads. Terminal remains authoritative for transaction execution.

`check:v37-gate4` validates package source, generated artifact freshness,
package tests, UI tests, docs, workflow wiring, source safety, mode/action
coverage, route-local draft keys, keyboard behavior, responsive fullscreen
layout, recovery states, proof roots, and source-safe handoff summaries.

## V37 Gate 5 ConversationSourceSelector context-policy canon

Gate 5 implements `ConversationSourceSelector` as the package-owned source
selection and context-policy contract for Website Conversations. It owns
repository, branch, commit, deposit, BTD range, AssetPack preview, document,
and prior conversation selectors. It emits
`.bitcode/v37-conversation-source-selector.json` with
`source-safe-conversation-source-selector-metadata`, deterministic row roots,
deterministic detail roots, selector kind ids, governance ids, preview states,
required field ids, proof roots, event ids, source evidence roots, and
source-safe disclosure limits.

Conversation source selection is route-local context metadata. It can select
source-safe references, preview allowed/denied/retry posture, and explain the
account, organization, wallet, rights, settlement, disclosure, and policy
dimensions that govern the selector. It does not reveal protected repository
source, unpaid AssetPack source, private BTD material, provider tokens, wallet
private material, settlement private payloads, raw protected prompts, raw
protected model responses, or global ledger authority claims. Full AssetPack
or BTD source visibility remains governed by rights transfer and settlement.

`check:v37-gate5` validates package source, generated artifact freshness,
package tests, UI tests, docs, workflow wiring, selector kind coverage,
governance coverage, allowed/denied/retry preview states, rights and
settlement posture, proof roots, event ids, and source-safe preview metadata.

## V37 Gate 6 ConversationTerminalHandoff canon

Gate 6 implements `ConversationTerminalHandoff` as the package-owned
transaction handoff contract from Website Conversations into the Bitcode
Terminal. It owns source-safe handoff envelopes for Depositing, Reading,
Finding Fits, Exchange, settlement, and delivery workflows. It emits
`.bitcode/v37-conversation-terminal-handoff.json` with
`source-safe-conversation-terminal-handoff-metadata`, deterministic row roots,
deterministic detail roots, workflow ids, field ids, authority boundary ids,
policy states, proof roots, event ids, source evidence roots, and source-safe
disclosure limits.

Conversation handoff is not execution. Conversations may prepare source-safe
transaction intent, preserve a route-local conversation id, selected
transaction id, repository anchor, source selector summaries, a user-readable
summary, policy result, proof root, and Terminal detail focus. The Terminal
remains the transaction cockpit and the only website surface that may proceed
into ledger, wallet, settlement, Exchange, delivery, and BTD ownership actions.
Conversation handoff payloads must not expose protected source, raw protected
prompts, protected model responses with source, provider tokens, wallet
private material, settlement private payloads, unpaid AssetPack source, ledger
write authority, wallet signing authority, or a Terminal authority bypass.

The Terminal route reads `conversationHandoff=1` context as source-safe
operator context. It may display the workflow, policy state, proof root,
repository anchor, source selector count, and handoff summary before the
operator chooses any Terminal action. `check:v37-gate6` validates package
source, generated artifact freshness, package tests, UI tests, Terminal route
tests, docs, workflow wiring, workflow coverage, authority boundaries,
proof roots, event ids, and source-safe handoff metadata.

## V37 Gate 7 ConversationPersistencePrivacyRedaction canon

Gate 7 implements `ConversationPersistencePrivacyRedaction` as the
package-owned durable storage privacy and redaction contract for Website
Conversations. It owns the visibility tier separation for public,
user-visible, organization-visible, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, and
operator-only data. It emits
`.bitcode/v37-conversation-persistence-privacy-redaction.json` with
`source-safe-conversation-persistence-privacy-redaction-metadata`,
deterministic row roots, deterministic detail roots, operation ids, visibility
tier ids, retention postures, required field ids, proof roots, event ids,
source evidence roots, and source-safe disclosure limits.

Conversation persistence is durable route-local projection state, not global
ledger truth. The persisted write path may store source-safe message content,
source context references, redaction posture, retention posture, proof roots,
and event ids. It must redact or block protected prompts, protected model
responses with source, protected source payloads, provider tokens, wallet
private material, settlement private payloads, private payment credentials,
operator private notes, unpaid AssetPack source, ledger write authority, and
wallet signing authority before durable storage, telemetry, export, replay, or
incident repair.

Gate 7 covers seven persistence operations: persist message, restore history,
export history, delete history, retain history, replay history, and incident
repair. Export may only include source-safe data visible to the requesting
principal. Delete leaves only a source-safe tombstone proof. Retention applies
the correct visibility tier without escalating disclosure. Replay reconstructs
prompt template ids and parsed result shapes, never raw protected prompts or
raw protected model responses. Incident repair may inspect proof roots and
redaction verdicts but cannot expose protected source or private wallet
material. `check:v37-gate7` validates package source, generated artifact
freshness, package tests, API storage redaction tests, UI tests, docs,
workflow wiring, visibility tier coverage, retention posture coverage, export
posture, delete posture, replay posture, incident repair posture, proof roots,
event ids, and source-safe persisted metadata.

## V37 Gate 8 ConversationTelemetryProofHooks canon

Gate 8 implements `ConversationTelemetryProofHooks` as the package-owned
telemetry, dashboard, runbook, and documentation contract for Website
Conversations. It owns source-safe event families for sessions, messages,
streams, tools, source selectors, Terminal handoffs, retries, errors, and
completions. It emits
`.bitcode/v37-conversation-telemetry-proof-hooks.json` with
`source-safe-conversation-telemetry-proof-hooks-metadata`, deterministic row
roots, hook roots, dashboard panel ids, runbook ids, required telemetry field
ids, proof root fields, source evidence roots, replay expectations, and
source-safe disclosure boundaries.

Conversation telemetry proof hooks may expose only event ids, conversation
ids, message ids, run ids, source selector refs, Terminal transaction refs,
state enums, counts, proof roots, dashboard panel ids, runbook ids, and
redacted error classes. They must not expose secret values, provider tokens,
wallet private material, protected source payloads, raw protected prompts,
raw provider responses with protected source, unpaid AssetPack source,
settlement private payloads, private payment credentials, operator private
notes, ledger write authority, or wallet signing authority.

Gate 8 binds conversation stream rows to source-safe telemetry proof hooks in
the API and gives the fullscreen Conversations UI a telemetry proof panel
that previews dashboard/runbook posture without source leakage. Public docs
explain route-local history, streaming, source selection, Terminal handoff,
privacy, retries, and telemetry proof hooks. Internal docs define the
dashboard panels and runbook ids operators use to debug failure and quality
posture without protected payloads. `check:v37-gate8` validates package
source, generated artifact freshness, package tests, API tests, UI tests,
public docs, internal runbooks, workflow wiring, dashboard coverage, runbook
coverage, event family coverage, proof roots, telemetry roots, source
evidence roots, and source-safe telemetry metadata.

## Inherited V36 Exchange canon

The promoted V36 sections below remain inherited canonical law for Exchange.
V37 Conversations may surface Exchange summaries and handoffs only through source-safe contract fields and may not reopen Exchange ownership, pricing, settlement, or disclosure law.

## V36 Gate 2 ExchangeActivityBook canon

Gate 2 implements `ExchangeActivityBook` as the package-owned source of market
activity truth for Exchange master-detail surfaces.
`ExchangeActivityBook` emits `.bitcode/v36-exchange-activity-book.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-activity-book-metadata`, deterministic activity row roots,
deterministic activity detail roots, required filter ids, event ids, proof
roots, ledger/database projection references, and redaction posture.
The activity detail never exposes protected source or unpaid AssetPack content;
it only exposes source-safe activity identity, summaries, measurements, proof
roots, rights and settlement posture, repair posture, revenue posture, and
ledger/database projection references.

The Gate 2 activity coverage is listing, bid, ask, cancellation, acceptance,
settlement, repair, revenue route, and history entry.
Each row binds an AssetPack id, BTD range id, source-safe principal references,
event ids, proof-root fields, detail sections, and fail-closed conditions for
missing proof roots, missing event ids, protected source visibility, unpaid
AssetPack source visibility, and ledger/database projection drift.

## V36 Gate 3 ExchangeIntent And ExchangeOrder canon

Gate 3 implements `ExchangeIntent` and `ExchangeOrder` as the package-owned
contracts for market action envelopes and order transitions.
`ExchangeIntent` owns source-safe buy, sell, bid, ask, cancel, accept, settle,
and history intent fields: actor principal, organization role, wallet posture,
authority proof, idempotency key, policy decision, target order, target BTD
range, source-safe preview, and fail-closed result.
`ExchangeOrder` owns the matching transition state: order identity, AssetPack
id, BTD range id, rights scope, current owner, order state, transition id,
history root, ledger journal reference, database projection reference, and
repair posture.

Gate 3 emits `.bitcode/v36-exchange-intent-order-contracts.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-intent-order-contract-metadata`.
Each transition names actor, organization role, wallet posture, authority proof,
idempotency key, policy decision, and fail-closed result before order mutation.
The order history is replayable without private wallet material or secrets; it
uses source-safe transition ids, intent roots, order roots, authority roots,
policy roots, idempotency roots, ledger journal refs, database projection refs,
and event ids.
The generated contract forbids protected source, unpaid AssetPack source,
wallet private material, provider tokens, raw protected prompts, raw protected
model responses, private buyer repository payloads, and secret values.
Ledger journal state remains stronger than database projection state for
Exchange order history and settlement/finality.

## V36 Gate 4 ExchangeRightsTransferPreview canon

Gate 4 implements `ExchangeRightsTransferPreview` as the package-owned contract
for AssetPack range trading and BTD rights-transfer review.
`ExchangeRightsTransferPreview` names BTD range identity, current owner,
requested buyer, rights scope, settlement unlock condition, disclosure limit,
source visibility, authority posture, proof roots, ledger/database projection
references, and fail-closed conditions before any source-bearing transfer can
be shown or settled.

Gate 4 emits `.bitcode/v36-exchange-rights-transfer-review.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-rights-transfer-review-metadata`.
AssetPack source is hidden until paid settlement and rights transfer are complete.
The preview may expose source-safe preview identity, AssetPack id, BTD
range identity, principal ids, rights scope, settlement unlock condition,
disclosure limit, proof roots, event ids, ledger/database projection refs, and
fail-closed conditions; it must not expose protected source, unpaid AssetPack
source, wallet private material, provider tokens, protected prompts, protected
model responses, private buyer repository payloads, or secret values.

The Gate 4 preview states distinguish owner-read, licensed-read, and blocked transfer.
Owner-read represents the current owner reviewing owned rights while
the Exchange preview itself stays source-safe. Licensed-read represents a buyer
or reader who may receive source only after paid BTC settlement and a BTD
read/right receipt. Blocked transfer represents stale ownership, missing
authority, policy denial, missing rights-transfer receipt, or projection drift
and admits no payment or delivery until repaired.
Ledger journal state remains stronger than database projection state for
rights-transfer preview, owner truth, and unlock state.

## V36 Gate 5 ExchangePricingQuote canon

Gate 5 implements `ExchangePricingQuote` as the package-owned deterministic
pricing contract for Exchange quote review.
`ExchangePricingQuote` names quote identity, quote state, AssetPack id, BTD
range identity, BTC amount, measurement weight, measurement volume, liquidity
band, wrapper analysis, treasury route, depositor route, reader route, quote
root, network posture, settlement window, fail-closed conditions, proof roots,
event ids, and ledger/database projection references before settlement can
continue.

Gate 5 emits `.bitcode/v36-pricing-liquidity-fee-quote.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-pricing-quote-metadata`.
The deterministic quote basis includes measurement weight, measurement volume, liquidity band, wrapper analysis, BTC amount, treasury route, depositor route, reader route, and quote root.
The source-safe quote may expose quote identity, AssetPack id, BTD range
identity, BTC amount, measurement metadata, liquidity metadata, wrapper
metadata, route metadata, proof roots, event ids, ledger/database projection
refs, and fail-closed conditions; it must not expose protected source, unpaid
AssetPack source, wallet private material, provider tokens, protected prompts,
protected model responses, private payment credentials, private buyer
repository payloads, or secret values.

wrapper analysis cannot make BTD range cells fungible chain-of-record assets.
BTD range cells remain non-fungible source-share identities whose chain of
record is the BTD range ledger journal, even when a wrapper is used for
pricing, review, transfer, or market UX metadata.
underpayment, overpayment, stale quote, or unsupported network posture fails closed.
Ledger journal state remains stronger than database projection state for quote
roots, settlement admission, payment matching, route allocation, and network
posture.

## V36 Gate 6 ExchangeSettlementReceipt canon

Gate 6 implements `ExchangeSettlementReceipt` as the package-owned settlement
and reconciliation contract for Exchange completion.
`ExchangeSettlementReceipt` binds payment observation, finality state, rights
transfer receipt, ledger root, database projection root, object storage root,
delivery state, repair id, observer jobs, reconciliation decision, proof roots,
and event ids before source-bearing delivery can be trusted.

Gate 6 emits `.bitcode/v36-exchange-settlement-reconciliation.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-settlement-reconciliation-metadata`.
The settlement binding is payment observation, finality state, rights transfer receipt, ledger root, database projection root, object storage root, delivery state, and repair id.
The source-safe receipt may expose settlement identity, payment observation,
finality state, rights-transfer receipt identity, ledger root, database
projection root, object storage root, delivery state, repair id, observer jobs,
proof roots, and event ids; it must not expose protected source, unpaid
AssetPack source, wallet private material, provider tokens, protected prompts,
protected model responses, private payment credentials, private buyer
repository payloads, object-storage private bytes, or secret values.

observers and repair jobs reconcile database projections to ledger truth.
The ledger journal remains stronger than database and object-storage
projections; repair jobs may rewrite projections toward ledger truth but cannot
rewrite ledger truth toward projection convenience.
settlement finality and delivery are auditable.
Delivery stays blocked while finality, rights-transfer receipt, database
projection, or object-storage projection is missing, stale, or drifted.

## V36 Gate 7 ExchangeDisputeRepairCase and ExchangeRevenueRoute canon

Gate 7 implements `ExchangeDisputeRepairCase` and `ExchangeRevenueRoute` as the
package-owned operational contracts for Exchange failures, repairs, operator
runbooks, and revenue conservation.
`ExchangeDisputeRepairCase` covers stale owner, cancelled order replay, underpayment, overpayment, projection drift, source leakage, and delivery mismatch.
Each case binds affected order identity, affected settlement receipt identity,
affected projection roots, source-safe repair command, verification command,
proof-rooted runbook, escalation path, proof roots, and event ids.

`ExchangeRevenueRoute` covers depositor, reader, treasury, fee, BTC route, BTD right route, and conservation proof.
Each route binds public principal ids, BTC debit/credit amounts, BTD range
identity, rights-transfer receipt identity, source-to-shares proof root, and a
conservation proof that reader debit equals depositor credit plus treasury
credit plus fee credit plus reader refund.

Gate 7 emits `.bitcode/v36-exchange-dispute-repair-revenue-route.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-dispute-repair-revenue-route-metadata`.
runbooks and repair commands are source-safe and proof-rooted.
The artifact may expose dispute identities, incident classes, affected order and
settlement ids, projection roots, source-safe repair commands, verification
commands, runbook ids, escalation status, revenue accounts, BTC amounts, BTD
right-route metadata, source-to-shares roots, conservation proofs, proof roots,
and event ids; it must not expose protected source, unpaid AssetPack source,
wallet private material, provider tokens, protected prompts, protected model
responses, private payment credentials, private buyer repository payloads,
object-storage private bytes, raw disputed source bytes, or secret values.

## V36 Gate 8 ExchangeUxProof canon

Gate 8 implements `ExchangeUxProof` as the package-owned contract binding the
Exchange route, Terminal handoff, and source-safe review surfaces to generated
proof.

`ExchangeUxProof` covers market-wide master-detail, filters, order history, rights-transfer review, pricing quote, settlement state, and repair state.
It proves that Terminal can hand off to Exchange without losing transaction context.
It also proves that collapsed UI gives readable status and expanded UI exposes source-safe detail.
Exchange telemetry dashboards remain source-safe and proof-rooted.

Gate 8 emits `.bitcode/v36-exchange-ux-proof.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-ux-proof-metadata`.
The artifact may expose route ids, transaction ids, filter ids, order state,
rights-transfer preview state, quote roots, settlement state, repair state,
proof roots, event ids, and source-safe UI detail metadata; it must not expose
protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, wallet private material, provider
tokens, protected prompts, protected model responses, buyer private repository
payloads, or secret values.

## V36 Gate 9 ExchangeRehearsal canon

Gate 9 implements `ExchangeRehearsal` as the package-owned contract binding
local and staging-testnet Exchange rehearsals to generated proof.

`ExchangeRehearsal` proves that local and staging-testnet rehearsals exercise list, bid, ask, cancel, accept, settle, repair, and history flows.
It proves that rehearsal logs/screenshots are source-safe.
It also proves that ledger/database synchronization and value-bearing mainnet blocking are visible.

Gate 9 emits `.bitcode/v36-exchange-rehearsal.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-rehearsal-metadata`.
The artifact may expose rehearsal ids, lane ids, flow ids, event ids, proof
roots, ledger/database synchronization checks, validation commands, redacted
log/screenshot roots, source evidence, and summary counts; it must not expose
protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, wallet private material, private
payment credentials, object-storage private bytes, provider tokens, protected
prompts, protected model responses, buyer private repository payloads, or secret
values.

## V36 Gate 10 ExchangePromotionReadinessReport canon

Gate 10 implements `ExchangePromotionReadinessReport` as the package-owned
contract that proves V36 can promote from active V35 / draft V36 to active V36 /
draft V37.

`ExchangePromotionReadinessReport` covers every V36 Exchange generated artifact,
the V36 promotion workflow, gate-quality and canon-quality workflow posture,
promotion command planning, dry-run support, generated proof appendix support,
runtime posture rewriting, and source-safe generated promotion evidence.

Gate 10 emits `.bitcode/v36-promotion-readiness-report.json` with
`source-safe-exchange-promotion-readiness-metadata`.
The artifact may expose artifact ids, proof roots, checksums, source-safe source
evidence, documentation evidence, validation commands, promotion workflow
coverage, and pre/post-promotion posture; it must not expose protected source,
unpaid AssetPack source, wallet private material, private payment credentials,
object-storage private bytes, provider tokens, protected prompts, protected
model responses, buyer private repository payloads, or secret values.

The exact post-promotion posture token is V36 active / draft V37.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode measures technical knowledge, finds deposits that fit reviewed Reads, synthesizes source-bearing AssetPacks, and settles read rights in BTC with BTD range and rights receipts.
The active V35 canon remains:

- Deposits supply source material to the Bitcode depository.
- A Read Request is synthesized into a reviewed ReadNeed by `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis`.
- `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` searches for plural threshold-passing fit deposits and synthesizes source-safe AssetPack preview records.
- Protected AssetPack source remains hidden before paid settlement.
- BTC is the fee asset and BTD range/read-license/right transfer is ledgerized.
- Paid settlement unlocks full AssetPack delivery, including pull-request delivery where applicable.
- Telemetry, documentation, dashboards, runbooks, docs QA, and rollout guides remain source-safe and proof-rooted.

V36 adds a market layer for existing BTD and AssetPack rights.
Exchange may list, quote, bid, ask, accept, cancel, settle, and repair rights-transfer activity, but it must not make BTD cells fungible, leak protected source, bypass paid settlement, or treat database projections as stronger than ledger truth.

## V36 source-of-truth hierarchy

The V36 source-of-truth hierarchy is:

1. `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`, which remains `V35` until V36 promotion.
2. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36.md` during V36 drafting.
3. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_NOTES.md`.
4. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_DELTA.md`.
5. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PARITY_MATRIX.md`.
6. generated V36 artifacts under `.bitcode/` when produced.
7. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md` only after promotion.
8. source implementation, tests, public docs, internal docs, telemetry definitions, and QA evidence that realize this family.

Older specifications are provenance only.
They must not become hidden current-system law.

## V36 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V36 must be re-implementable and auditable from its specification family without reading conversation history.
Every Exchange activity row, order state, intent envelope, pricing quote, rights-transfer preview, settlement receipt, dispute case, repair operation, revenue route, UI state, API payload, telemetry event, proof root, and generated artifact must identify:

- canonical object;
- required inputs;
- outputs and stored artifacts;
- deterministic, inferred, external, ledger-derived, or policy-derived fields;
- proof obligations;
- failure and repair posture;
- implementation and validation surfaces.

## V36 totality and precision enforcement rule

V36 fails closed when any Exchange behavior lacks explicit ownership, authority, source-safety class, disclosure posture, ledger/database synchronization rule, BTD range identity rule, BTC fee rule, proof root, telemetry event, and repair path.
Each gate must preserve exact abstraction names:

- executions are the base runtime records;
- pipelines compose phase-wise behavior;
- agents are PTRR agents;
- PTRR steps are the four formal agent steps;
- sub-steps are ThricifiedGenerations;
- pipeline inference points are ThricifiedGenerations;
- tools are registry-backed tool calls;
- prompts are prompt-part and prompt-template registry compositions;
- interfaces are contract consumers, not owners of protocol truth;
- Exchange is a product surface over BTD/AssetPack rights, not a replacement tokenomics layer;
- ledger records and journals outrank database projections for settlement and ownership truth.

No source identifier may introduce a versioned route, gate, or work-in-progress name unless explicitly accepted as a bounded compatibility artifact.

## V36 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- define Exchange market-wide activity master-detail contracts;
- define buy, sell, bid, ask, cancel, accept, settle, and history flows;
- define AssetPack range trading and BTD rights-transfer review without source leakage;
- define deterministic pricing, liquidity, fee quote, wrapper, and measurement-weight analysis;
- define ledger/database/object-storage reconciliation for Exchange settlement;
- define dispute, repair, and revenue-route operations specific to market activity;
- integrate Exchange with Terminal navigation, public docs, telemetry, dashboards, runbooks, and local/staging rehearsal.

Non-goals:

- no new BTD supply or tokenomics law;
- no fungible wrapper as chain-of-record for non-fungible source-share cells;
- no bridge chain-of-record implementation;
- no website Conversations product-depth implementation;
- no rewrite of `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` or `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis`;
- no exposure of protected AssetPack source before settlement;
- no value-bearing production-mainnet approval.

Design principles:

- source-safe preview before market action;
- ledger-derived ownership before database convenience;
- deterministic price and fee roots before UI totals;
- cancel and repair paths before optimistic settlement display;
- revenue routing before operator dashboard polish;
- public Exchange documentation discloses market posture and rights boundaries, not protected source.

## V36 system architecture and layer boundaries

V36 preserves the V35 architecture and adds Exchange ownership:

- `packages/protocol` owns canon posture, spec-family checks, generated-proof helpers, Exchange proof helper APIs, and promotion-governance helper APIs.
- `packages/btd` owns BTD range identity, read-license, rights transfer, wallet capability, fee posture, settlement, access policy, reconciliation primitives, and value-lane admission boundaries.
- `packages/api` owns JSON-safe reusable route contracts over package primitives and must expose Exchange posture only through source-safe schemas.
- `packages/pipelines/asset-pack` owns Reading pipeline contracts and source-safe preview outputs; Exchange may reference settled AssetPack rights but must not redefine Reading law.
- `packages/executions-mcp` owns MCP server contracts and tool exposure; Exchange MCP exposure must derive from package-owned contracts.
- `packages/chatgptapp` owns ChatGPT App action contracts and source-safe response rendering.
- `uapi` owns commercial product routes and user interfaces, including `/exchange`, but not protocol truth or settlement law.
- `protocol-demonstration` remains a standalone minimal reference and proof witness outside the workspace import graph.
- deployment host services own runtime carriers, queues, observers, broadcasters, repair jobs, object storage, and environment variables through inherited V34/V35 contracts.
- public `/docs` surfaces own enterprise-facing guidance but must derive from protocol/package truth.

Layer boundaries:

- Commercial interfaces may call commercial APIs and packages; they must not import demonstration runtime code.
- Exchange may show source-safe market, proof, fee, and rights-transfer metadata before settlement; it must not show protected AssetPack source before payment and rights transfer.
- Ledger records and journals are source-of-truth for settlement/finality; Supabase/PostgreSQL projections must not contradict them.
- Object storage carries source-bearing AssetPacks, proof bundles, generated artifacts, and rollback material only under explicit disclosure and retention policy.
- Value-bearing mainnet activity is blocked until a future canon admits it; V36 may define readiness and dry-run proof, not production value launch.

## V36 proof/test package API and inherited support canon

V36 treats package APIs as the source of Exchange truth.
The formal package boundaries are:

- `@bitcode/protocol` owns active/draft canon posture, generated proof helpers, and V36 Exchange check helpers.
- `@bitcode/btd` owns rights, range, fee, wallet, access, treasury, reconciliation, and value-lane admission primitives.
- `@bitcode/api` owns reusable JSON contracts for public API consumers and source-safe Exchange posture.
- `@bitcode/pipeline-asset-pack` owns Reading pipeline contract surfaces and source-safe preview outputs that Exchange may reference after settlement.
- MCP and ChatGPT App packages consume those contracts rather than inventing interface-local shapes.

The commercial protocol package owns the active/draft posture while V36 is in flight:

- `ACTIVE_CANON_VERSION = 'V35'`;
- `DRAFT_TARGET_VERSION = 'V36'`;
- spec-family, canonical-input, canon-posture-drift, and proven-generation helpers remain exported through the package index;
- package tests and V36 checks fail closed on direct demonstration-source imports and source-unsafe Exchange output.

Any Exchange object used by more than one runtime lane, interface, package, docs surface, dashboard, or runbook must have a package-owned type, builder, parser, validator, source-safe fixture, example, compatibility row, replay command where relevant, and generated artifact before the gate that depends on it closes.

## V36 canonical domain model

V36 adds Exchange contract objects over V35 protocol and deployment truth:

- `ExchangeActivityBook`: activity id, activity kind, assetPack id, BTD range id, principal ids, state, source-safe summary, proof roots, ledger/database projection refs, event ids, and detail link.
- `ExchangeIntent`: intent id, actor principal, organization role, action kind, target range, quote root, authority proof, policy result, idempotency key, and fail-closed reason.
- `ExchangeOrder`: order id, side, range, AssetPack rights scope, owner posture, price quote, expiration, cancellability, acceptability, settlement state, and repair posture.
- `ExchangeRightsTransferPreview`: source-safe preview of current ownership, requested transfer, price root, fee root, disclosure boundary, settlement unlock condition, and post-settlement delivery condition.
- `ExchangePricingQuote`: BTC amount, measurement weights, measurement volume, liquidity band, wrapper analysis, fee split, treasury route, depositor route, reader route, and deterministic quote root.
- `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`: payment observation, finality state, rights transfer receipt, ledger root, database projection root, object storage root, delivery state, and repair id.
- `ExchangeDisputeRepairCase`: incident class, dispute reason, affected order, affected settlement, affected projection, repair command, verification command, proof root, and escalation path.
- `ExchangeRevenueRoute`: treasury account, depositor account, reader account, fee account, BTC route, BTD right route, source-to-shares route, and conservation proof.

Inherited V35 objects remain active: `Deposit`, `ReadRequest`, `ReadNeed`, `FindingFitsResult`, `AssetPackPreview`, `SettlementUnlock`, `BtcFeeQuote`, `BtdAssetPackMintReceipt`, `BtdReadReceipt`, `BtdRightsTransferReceipt`, `SourceToSharesProof`, `TerminalTransaction`, `TelemetryTaxonomyCatalog`, `DocumentationSurfaceCatalog`, `DocsQaAlignmentReport`, `OperatorRunbookCatalog`, `TestnetRolloutReadinessGuide`, `McpToolContract`, `ChatGptAppActionContract`, `PublicApiRouteContract`, and `InterfaceTelemetryProofHook`.

## V36 gate plan

V36 closes through ten gates:

1. **Gate 1: V36 Exchange Roadmap And Spec Opening** opens the V36 family over V35 canon, updates `SPECIFICATIONS_ROADMAP.md`, documents V35 active / V36 draft posture, and wires `check:v36-gate1`.
2. **Gate 2: Exchange Activity Book And Market Master Detail** defines `ExchangeActivityBook` source-safe rows for market-wide activity, filters, detail panes, proof roots, and telemetry bindings.
3. **Gate 3: Buy Sell Bid Ask Cancel Accept Intent Contracts** defines `ExchangeIntent` and `ExchangeOrder` action envelopes, authorization, idempotency, cancelability, acceptability, and history transitions.
4. **Gate 4: AssetPack Range Trading And Rights Transfer Review** defines BTD range/AssetPack rights-transfer preview, source-safe disclosure, ownership checks, and settlement unlock boundaries.
5. **Gate 5: Pricing Liquidity Fee Quote And Wrapper Analysis** defines deterministic BTC price, measurement-weight, volume, liquidity, wrapper, fee-split, and quote-root calculations.
6. **Gate 6: Exchange Settlement Ledger Database Reconciliation** defines `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`, finality, ledger/database/object-storage synchronization, projection repair, and observer hooks.
7. **Gate 7: Dispute Repair Revenue Route Operations** defines dispute cases, repair jobs, revenue routes, conservation proofs, escalation, and operator runbooks.
8. **Gate 8: Exchange UX And Terminal Navigation Integration** wires Exchange master-detail, Terminal handoff, source-safe review states, public docs, and telemetry dashboards.
9. **Gate 9: Local Staging Exchange Rehearsal And Proof Coverage** rehearses local/staging-testnet Exchange flows with source-safe logs, proof roots, DB/ledger synchronization checks, and blocked value-bearing mainnet posture.
10. **Gate 10: V36 Promotion Readiness** generates V36 Exchange proof artifacts, promotion readiness, active V36 / draft V37 posture, and canonical promotion support.

## V36 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V36 whole-system operator chain is:

1. Depositor deposits source material.
2. Reader requests a Read.
3. `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` synthesizes a reviewed ReadNeed.
4. `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` finds plural fit deposits and synthesizes a source-safe AssetPack preview.
5. Reader pays BTC fee and receives BTD read/right transfer.
6. AssetPack delivery occurs after settlement and rights transfer.
7. Exchange lists eligible BTD range or AssetPack rights only after ownership and disclosure checks pass.
8. Buyer or seller submits source-safe market intent.
9. Exchange quotes price, liquidity, fee, wrapper, and rights-transfer preview.
10. Buyer accepts, cancels, bids, asks, settles, or reviews history through source-safe states.
11. Observers, broadcasters, repair jobs, and storage carriers reconcile settlement, finality, rights, delivery, and proof state through inherited V34/V35 deployment and telemetry law.

## V36 canonical subsystem surfaces

### Depositing and asset supply

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: `Deposit`, depository records, owner authority, source-to-shares proof, and Exchange eligibility metadata.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: deposited source is measured and rights-bearing only through inherited Reading and BTD law before it can become Exchange-eligible.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: invalid deposit, missing ownership, revoked policy, or protected source leakage blocks Exchange listing.
- Current proof obligations: source root, owner authority root, BTD range root, and disclosure root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: commercial packages and UAPI routes, not demonstration imports.

### Reading and prompt/inference ownership

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: `ReadRequest`, `ReadNeed`, `FindingFitsResult`, `AssetPackPreview`, pipeline execution records, PTRR agent records, and ThricifiedGeneration records.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: Reading remains owned by `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis`; Exchange references settled rights only.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, or unpaid preview blocks Exchange sale of nonexistent rights.
- Current proof obligations: prompt root, inference root, preview root, settlement unlock root, and disclosure root.

### Fit, recall, ranking, and verification

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: fit deposits, recall/ranking evidence, verification decisions, AssetPack preview, and rights-transfer eligibility.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: recall and ranking remain Reading functions; Exchange may sort market entries by source-safe measurements and price metadata.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: no-survivor asset pack, stale verification, or ownership mismatch blocks listing and settlement.
- Current proof obligations: fit root, verification root, measurement root, and order eligibility root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: pipeline packages, BTD packages, and API contracts.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: V36 market master-detail and rights-transfer gates.

### Selection and materialization

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: selected AssetPack source, delivery branch, object storage root, BTD range root, Exchange order root, and settlement receipt.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: materialization remains post-settlement for protected source; Exchange can preview measurements and roots only.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: unpaid source, missing fee quote, stale settlement, storage drift, delivery mismatch, or order cancellation blocks delivery.

### Identity, authorization, and sensitive flow

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: principal, organization role, wallet capability, owner authority, order authorization, and policy decision.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: only authorized owners can list or transfer rights; only authorized buyers can settle.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: authorization denial, stale owner, wallet mismatch, revoked org role, or policy failure blocks Exchange intent.
- Current proof obligations: auth root, wallet root, policy root, role root, and signature root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: BTD, API, Auth, Terminal, Exchange, and Auxillaries packages/routes.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: inherited V31/V33/V35 auth/interface checks plus V36 intent gates.

### Disclosure and projection

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: source-safe market preview, rights-transfer preview, disclosure policy, telemetry event, docs link, and redaction proof.

### Proof contract, witnesses, and replay

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: generated proof appendix, Exchange generated artifacts, proof-family reports, telemetry records, and rehearsal evidence.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: V36 generated artifacts derive from package-owned builders and fail closed on stale or source-unsafe payloads.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: stale promoted status truth, missing generated artifact, stale proof root, unsupported disclosure, or replay mismatch blocks gate closure.
- Current proof obligations: proof family root, generated artifact root, workflow root, rehearsal root, and promotion root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: `packages/protocol`, scripts, workflows, and generated `.bitcode/` artifacts.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: `check:v36-gate1` through `check:v36-gate10`, spec-family checks, canonical-input checks, and canon-posture drift checks.

## V36 generated canon

V36 generated canon consists of source-safe `.bitcode/` artifacts generated by package-owned builders and checked by scripts.

### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

V36 inherits deterministic replay, volatility, theorem-evidence, proof-member, state-machine, and contract-change artifact expectations.

### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

V36 inherits operator quality, visual/accessibility/performance posture, projection-quality smoke checks, and generated quality report expectations.

### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| artifactPath | owning gate | disclosure posture | source basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v36-spec-family-report.json` | Gate 1 | source-safe | spec-family checker |

| `.bitcode/v37-conversation-source-selector.json` | Gate 5 | source-safe | ConversationSourceSelector source/context policy contracts |

### V37 specifying generated artifacts

Gate 1 requires `.bitcode/v37-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v37-canonical-input-report.json`, and `.bitcode/v37-canon-posture-drift-report.json` readiness.
Gate 2 adds `.bitcode/v37-conversation-session-route-history.json` from the package-owned ConversationSession route-history builder with package tests, route tests, workflow checks, and source-safety checks.
Gate 3 adds `.bitcode/v37-conversation-stream-event-contract.json` from the package-owned ConversationStreamEvent builder with package tests, route/UI tests, workflow checks, and source-safety checks.
Gate 4 adds `.bitcode/v37-conversation-writing-workspace.json` from the package-owned ConversationWritingWorkspace builder with package tests, fullscreen workspace UI tests, workflow checks, and source-safety checks.
Gate 5 adds `.bitcode/v37-conversation-source-selector.json` from the package-owned ConversationSourceSelector builder with package tests, source selector UI tests, workflow checks, and source-safety checks.
Later V37 gates add Conversations generated artifacts only when their package-owned builders, route checks, stream tests, telemetry checks, and source-safety tests exist.

### Shared generated-artifact fields

Every V36 generated artifact includes version, artifact id, generated at, source evidence, proof roots, disclosure posture, forbidden payload classes, validation commands, and deterministic row roots where rows exist.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Exchange artifacts add activity ids, intent ids, order ids, range ids, quote roots, rights-transfer roots, settlement roots, dispute ids, repair commands, revenue routes, dashboard/runbook ids, and rehearsal evidence roots.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

V36 artifacts are public, internal, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, or operator-only.
No source-safe public artifact may carry secrets, wallet private material, raw protected prompts, raw protected model responses with source, buyer private repository data, or unpaid AssetPack source.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

`BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md` must render aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when generated evidence is stale or source-unsafe.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

V36 generated canon must be regenerated through package scripts and workflow checks.
The system fails closed when generated artifacts are missing, stale, source-unsafe, or inconsistent with `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`, the V36 family, or the proof-source commit.

## V36 validation canon

V36 validation consists of:

## V36 promotion readiness canon

V36 promotion readiness canon is carried by `ExchangePromotionReadinessReport`
and `.bitcode/v36-promotion-readiness-report.json`.

## V36 promotion canon

V36 promotion may occur only after all ten gates close and the version promotion workflow validates:

- all V36 gate checks;
- generated V36 Exchange artifacts;
- source-safe public documentation and telemetry;
- local/staging-testnet rehearsal evidence;
- generated `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md`;
- promotion dry-run;
- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer rewrite from `V35` to `V36`.

Promotion rewrites runtime posture from `V35` active / `V36` draft to `V36` active / `V37` draft only after validations pass.

## V36 appendices and canonical supporting material

### Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

V36 canonical type surfaces are `ExchangeActivityBook`, `ExchangeIntent`, `ExchangeOrder`, `ExchangeRightsTransferPreview`, `ExchangePricingQuote`, `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`, `ExchangeDisputeRepairCase`, and `ExchangeRevenueRoute`.
Public surfaces include `/exchange`, Terminal handoff panels, source-safe API payloads, public docs, telemetry dashboards, and operator runbooks.

### Appendix C. Generated artifact contract catalog

The V36 generated artifact contract catalog is defined in the generated canon section and includes `.bitcode/v36-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v36-canonical-input-report.json`, and all Exchange gate artifacts.

### Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

| gate | command | required posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gate 1 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate1` | V35 active / V36 draft |
| Gate 2 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate2` | Exchange activity book implemented |
| Gate 3 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate3` | intent/order contracts implemented |
| Gate 4 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate4` | rights-transfer review implemented |
| Gate 5 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate5` | pricing quote implemented |
| Gate 6 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate6` | settlement reconciliation implemented |
| Gate 7 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate7` | dispute/repair/revenue implemented |
| Gate 8 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate8` | UX integration implemented |
| Gate 9 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate9` | rehearsal implemented |
| Gate 10 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate10` | promotion readiness implemented |

### Appendix E. Current canonical source map

V36 source map roots include `packages/protocol`, `packages/btd`, `packages/api`, `packages/pipelines/asset-pack`, `uapi/app/exchange`, `uapi/app/terminal`, `uapi/app/api`, public docs, workflows, scripts, and generated `.bitcode/` artifacts.
`_legacy/` is historical only.

### Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

V36 subsystem totality covers repo supply and depositing, reading and measured demand, prompt/inference/evaluator ownership, deposit-to-read fit, recall and ranking, verification decisions, selection and materialization, branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence, identity, authority, signing, and policy, sensitive data and confidentiality flows, projection, disclosure, and redaction, proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay, settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting, telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics, host/runtime capability truth, operator experience and pedagogy, validation and test stack, generated artifacts and canonical promotion.

### Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

V36 file family: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and generated `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md` after promotion.
Promotion requires a version PR into `main`, promotion workflow validation, generated proof output, and `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer update.

### Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces include Exchange market dashboard, activity detail, order history, settlement review, dispute repair, revenue route review, Terminal handoff, telemetry dashboards, alert runbooks, local/staging rehearsal, and public docs.
Quality gates require accessible master-detail navigation, source-safe collapsed/expanded detail, deterministic state labels, repair instructions, and proof-root visibility.

### Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

Required cross-product scenarios remain active for auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, and auth-many-asset-normalization.
V36 Exchange scenarios must preserve Targeted deposit and Normalization deposit readings, patch/context/public asset types, buyer/reviewer/internal audiences, and Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, Valuable posture.

### Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

V36 preserves existing fail-closed causes: invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, stale promoted status truth, stale owner, cancelled order, underpayment, overpayment, projection drift, source leakage, missing rights transfer, and missing proof root.

### Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing material includes `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V37_PROVEN.md`.
Conversations may reference those roots through source-safe summaries and handoffs but must not disclose protected source before settlement, rights, and policy admit it.

## V37 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

- V37 owns Website Conversations.
- V37 inherits promoted V36 Exchange law and must not reopen Exchange ownership, pricing, rights-transfer, settlement, or disclosure rules.
- V37 does not authorize value-bearing production-mainnet launch.
- V37 does not replace the V28 ChatGPT App or V33 interface contracts.
- V37 does not redefine BTD supply, BTC fee separation, AssetPack range identity, owner-read/licensed-read law, measureminting, ancestry, or Reading pipeline product law.
- V37 may reopen Conversations gate scope only through a documented parity row, accepted boundary, and checker update.

## V37 completion condition

V37 is complete only when all ten Conversations gates have package-owned contracts, source-safe route and stream behavior, tests, documentation, workflow checks, parity closure, local/staging rehearsal evidence, and promotion readiness sufficient to rewrite `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` from `V36` to `V37` through the version promotion workflow.
