## Version executive summary

V39 is the commercial Reading readiness version.
It follows V38 by preserving the inference stack V38 made exact and applying it to the complete enterprise buyer path: request a read, review or resynthesize Bitcode's Need comprehension, request Finding Fits, review a source-safe AssetPack preview and deterministic BTC quote, settle, receive BTD rights, and receive the full AssetPack only after settlement unlock.

V39 must turn the source-safe pipeline surfaces promoted through V28-V38 into a reliable product flow.
Deposits must be indexed and searchable as Depository supply.
`ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` must store reviewable Needs and resynthesis history.
`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` must search many candidate deposits above threshold, rank and verify them, preserve selected-fit provenance, and feed synthesis without leaking unpaid source.
AssetPack preview must expose only measurements, fit reasons, quality posture, proof roots, pricing posture, and non-source metadata before settlement.
Settlement must produce auditable BTC, BTD rights-transfer, source-to-shares compensation, ledger/database/storage, delivery, and repair receipts.
Terminal and Conversation surfaces must present the flow as a clear five-step enterprise Reading experience while keeping expandable source-safe detail for operators.

## V39 commercial Reading law

V39 uses the existing primitive names precisely:

- `PipelineExecution` owns phase ordering, phase inputs, phase outputs, ancestry state, phase receipts, and pipeline telemetry.
- PTRR agents own `Plan`, `Try`, `Refine`, and `Retry` steps plus agent-level prompt registry composition.
- PTRR steps own their prompt registries, selected tools, Failsafe usage, typed step outputs, step receipts, and step telemetry.
- `FailsafeGenerationSequence` owns context preparation, large input handling, large output handling, stitch or summarization loops, and repair orchestration around the final typed inference chain.
- `ThricifiedGeneration` owns the lowest-level Reason, Judge, and StructuredOutput inference calls.
- `ToolExecution` owns callable tool input, execution, output, errors, and receipts.
- `DocCodeToolPrompt` and `formatUsableTools` own doc-comment-backed tool definitions that are injected into final prompts when tools are available to a step.

Tools are step-owned capabilities.
They are not hidden children of `ThricifiedGeneration`, but tool documentation must still be available to the final prompt material consumed by `ThricifiedGeneration`.
Every inference envelope must preserve template identity, prompt part identity, interpolated prompt, context bindings, selected tools, raw response presence, parsed typed result, schema verdict, retry or repair state, disclosure tier, proof root, and execution ancestry root at the permitted telemetry tier.

The enterprise Reading product path has five user-visible stages:

1. Request Read: capture repository/deposit anchors, enterprise intent, constraints, disclosure posture, and target outcome.
2. Review Synthesized Need: run `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis`, show a reviewable Need, and allow feedback-driven resynthesis without admitting Finding Fits until accepted.
3. Request Finding Fits: run `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` against the Depository using accepted Need measurements, query plans, tools, embeddings, and ranking thresholds.
4. Review Synthesized AssetPack Preview: show only source-safe measurements, fit reasons, proof roots, quality posture, pricing quote, selected-fit provenance, and delivery posture.
5. Buy AssetPack And Settle: observe BTC payment, transfer BTD rights, unlock source-bearing delivery, create or repair the pull request, and synchronize ledger/database/storage receipts.

## V39 Reading pipeline focus

`ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` are the primary Reading pipelines under V39.
They must be audited from phase to agent to step to Failsafe substep to Thricified generation to tool to typed output.
The audit must count every inference point separately, name the prompts and PromptParts used by that point, define input context, define output schemas, define failure or repair behavior, and identify where the result is stored and streamed.

`ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` must synthesize an enterprise user's Read Request into a reviewable Need that says exactly what should be read, what must not be over-inferred, which repository/deposit constraints apply, and what measurements drive fit-finding.

`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` must discover many possible fits, not one fit.
It must gather above-threshold deposits from the Depository, rank and verify those candidates, preserve found-fit provenance, and hand the selected fits into AssetPack synthesis.
Before settlement, the Reader may see only source-safe measurements, fit reasons, quality posture, pricing posture, proof roots, and preview metadata.
After settlement, delivery may cross the visibility boundary and provide the full AssetPack source as governed by BTD rights transfer and ledger/database synchronization.

## V39 gate plan

### Gate 1: Commercial Reading Roadmap And Spec Opening

Gate 1 opens V39 correctly:

- V39 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY files exist over active V38.
- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` remains `V38`.
- README, roadmap, PR template, package docs, demonstration docs, and workflows describe V38 active / V39 draft posture.
- `check:v39-gate1` validates branch naming, spec family, notes, parity, roadmap truth, workflow posture, inference vocabulary, depository-search vocabulary, and promotion boundaries.
- The V39 gate list is explicit before inference implementation begins.

### Gate 2: Depository Supply Indexing And Searchable Deposit Lifecycle

Gate 2 closes Depository supply reality for Reading.
It must make deposited source materials measurable, indexable, vector-searchable, metadata-searchable, rights-aware, and repairable as the source set that Finding Fits can search.
The gate is closed by package-backed source, deterministic source-safe artifact generation, deposit lifecycle tests, embedding/vector policy tests, Supabase/storage projection readback, and a checker that proves no protected source or credentials enter public artifacts.

Gate 2 introduces `DepositorySupplyIndex` as the package-owned source-safe
index over deposited source supply. Each `DepositorySupplyRecord` binds
repository, branch, commit, proof root, measurement root, reconciliation
readback root, source-safe search documents, vector projection rows, storage
readback posture, repair actions, and the depositor/reader rights boundary.
Its search documents are lexical, metadata, measurement, and vector documents
derived from source-safe metadata only. Raw protected source remains stored
outside the index and is never visible to the Reader before settlement. The
active vector policy remains OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dimensions,
cosine `match_deliverable_vectors`; rows that are missing or dimension-invalid
produce repair posture rather than pretending the corpus is searchable.
`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` consumes the index by converting records into
source-safe `DepositoryAsset` candidates for Finding Fits.

### Gate 3: Enterprise Reading UX State Machine

Gate 3 implements the five-step enterprise Reading path in Terminal and connected Conversation handoffs.
The UX must default to clear low-detail guidance while preserving expandable source-safe operational detail for every step, pipeline run, quote, settlement, and delivery state.
The gate is closed by route state contracts, component tests, browser proof, stream-log integration, and source-safe disclosure tests.
The implementation basis is `TerminalEnterpriseReadingUxState`, exported from
`uapi/app/terminal/terminal-enterprise-reading-ux-state.ts`, with five stable
steps: `request-read`, `review-synthesized-need`, `request-fit`,
`review-synthesized-asset-pack`, and `buy-asset-pack-settle`.
Conversation handoffs may carry only source-safe stage intent through the
`readingStage` query parameter and `terminalEnterpriseReadingStage` metadata;
Terminal remains the transaction authority. The generated source-safe proof
artifact is `.bitcode/v39-enterprise-reading-ux-state.json`, checked by
`pnpm run check:v39-gate3`.

### Gate 4: ReadNeed Review, Resynthesis, And Admission Runtime

Gate 4 makes `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` a real review loop.
It must persist Read Requests, synthesized Needs, feedback, resynthesis attempts, Need measurements, accepted-Need admission, rejected-Need posture, and telemetry receipts.
Finding Fits remains blocked until a reviewed Need is accepted.
The implementation basis is `ReadNeedReviewResynthesisRuntime`, exported from
`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/read-need-review-resynthesis.ts`. It projects
source-safe storage records for `read_request`, `synthesized_need`, `feedback`,
`resynthesis_attempt`, `need_measurement`, `accepted_need_admission`,
`rejected_need_posture`, and `telemetry_receipt`. The generated source-safe
proof artifact is `.bitcode/v39-read-need-review-resynthesis.json`, checked by
`pnpm run check:v39-gate4`. Rejected or unaccepted Needs must emit Finding Fits
blockers; only `acceptReadNeed` may produce Finding Fits admission.

### Gate 5: ReadFitsFinding Runtime, Ranking, And Replay

Gate 5 makes `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` search the whole available Depository for many candidate deposits.
It must execute inference-derived query planning, lexical/symbolic/path/metadata/measurement/vector/provider channels, threshold ranking, verification, selected-fit provenance, replay receipts, and repair paths over the accepted Need.
The active vector policy remains OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dimensions, cosine similarity, and `match_deliverable_vectors` until a tested migration is specified.
The implementation basis is `ReadFitsFindingRuntime`, exported from
`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/read-fits-finding-runtime.ts`. It wraps
the depository search result with `ReadFitsFindingReplayReceipt`,
`ReadFitsFindingStorageRecord`, `ReadFitsFindingTelemetryReceipt`, and
`ReadFitsFindingRepairPosture` projections so an accepted Need can replay the
source-safe query plan, ranking root, selected-fit provenance root, embedding
policy, and candidate counts without exposing protected source or unpaid
AssetPack source. The generated source-safe proof artifact is
`.bitcode/v39-read-fits-finding-runtime.json`, checked by
`pnpm run check:v39-gate5`.

### Gate 6: AssetPack Preview, Quote, And Disclosure Boundary

Gate 6 makes source-safe AssetPack preview reviewable and actionable without leaking source.
It must synthesize a preview from selected fits, expose fit measurements, quality reasons, proof roots, deterministic BTC quote, selected-fit provenance, delivery posture, and settlement instructions while withholding source-bearing AssetPack content until paid.
The implementation basis is `AssetPackPreviewBoundary`, exported from
`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/asset-pack-preview-boundary.ts`. It wraps
`AssetPackSourceSafePreview`, `AssetPackPreviewQuoteReceipt`,
`AssetPackDisclosureReview`, `AssetPackPreviewSettlementInstructions`,
`AssetPackPreviewDeliveryPosture`, `AssetPackPreviewReplayReceipt`, and
`AssetPackPreviewRepairPosture` so preview review is sufficient for buyer review
without exposing protected source, raw protected prompts, raw provider
responses, credentials, wallet private material, private settlement payloads,
or unpaid AssetPack source. The deterministic proof artifact is
`.bitcode/v39-assetpack-preview-quote-boundary.json`, checked by
`pnpm run check:v39-gate6`.

### Gate 7: Settlement, BTD Rights Transfer, And Delivery

Gate 7 closes the paid boundary.
It must observe BTC settlement, bind finality, mint or transfer the relevant BTD rights, allocate source-to-shares compensation to contributors, unlock source-bearing AssetPack delivery, create or repair the pull request, and synchronize ledger/database/object-storage receipts.
The implementation basis is `AssetPackSettlementRightsDeliveryBoundary`,
exported from
`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/asset-pack-settlement-rights-delivery.ts`.
It composes BTD receipt primitives, source-to-shares compensation,
settlement-unlock readback, and ledger/database/object-storage reconciliation
into a source-safe paid-boundary receipt. It emits
`AssetPackSettlementPaymentObservation`,
`AssetPackSettlementFinalityReceipt`, `SourceToSharesProof`,
`BtdRightsTransferReceipt`, `BtdReadReceipt`,
`AssetPackDeliveryUnlockReceipt`,
`AssetPackSettlementRightsDeliveryReplayReceipt`, and repair posture records
without serializing protected source, private wallet material, private
settlement payloads, credentials, raw protected prompts, or raw provider
responses. The deterministic source-safe proof artifact is
`.bitcode/v39-settlement-rights-delivery.json`, checked by
`pnpm run check:v39-gate7`.

### Gate 8: Operational Telemetry, Repair, And Operator Readback

Gate 8 makes the Reading product observable and repairable.
It must stream source-safe phase, agent, step, Failsafe, ThricifiedGeneration, tool, storage, ledger, wallet, delivery, and UI events into the rich execution log and operator readback surfaces with proof roots and runbook hooks.

The package-owned closure type is `ReadingOperationalTelemetryRepairReadback`
in
`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/reading-operational-telemetry-repair-readback.ts`.
It projects `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and
`ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` pipeline contracts into
`ReadingOperationalTelemetryEvent` rows for phase, PTRR agent, PTRR step,
`FailsafeGenerationSequence`, `ThricifiedGeneration`, `ToolExecution`,
storage, ledger, wallet, delivery, UI, and repair posture. Each event carries
`ReadingOperationalExecutionState` with event id, proof root,
prompt-template identity, output schema/return type, redaction posture,
prompt disclosure posture, result disclosure posture, and fail-closed state
where applicable.

The operator readback persists `ReadingOperationalOperatorReadback`,
source-safe stream events, repair runbook hooks, telemetry roots, repair
roots, and readback roots under `reading/operational`. The shared rich
execution log accepts direct operational telemetry payloads and renders
Reading pipeline, phase, PTRR agent, PTRR step, Failsafe, generation, tool,
schema, event, proof, disclosure, and fail-closed metadata in collapsed rows
with expandable details. No operational artifact may serialize protected
source, raw protected prompts, raw interpolated prompts, raw provider
responses, unpaid AssetPack source, wallet private material, private
settlement payloads, or credentials. The deterministic source-safe proof
artifact is `.bitcode/v39-operational-telemetry-repair-readback.json`,
checked by `pnpm run check:v39-gate8`.

### Gate 9: Interface And Conversation Product Parity

Gate 9 brings Conversation, MCP/API, ChatGPT App, and package-facing interfaces into the same Reading contract without creating parallel authority.
Every interface must respect accepted-Need gating, source-safe preview, settlement unlock, BTD rights, and delivery boundaries.

The package-owned closure type is `ReadingInterfaceProductParity` in
`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/reading-interface-product-parity.ts`.
It projects Terminal, Conversation, public API, MCP API, ChatGPT App, and
package-consumer surfaces into one source-safe contract. Conversation is a
Terminal-delegated handoff, package consumers receive contract readback only,
and API/MCP/ChatGPT actions compose the existing BTD interface contract,
read-license, AssetPack-rights, telemetry hook, and consumer UX primitives.
Every `ReadingInterfaceProductParityRow` proves accepted-Need gating,
Finding Fits admission, source-safe preview, settlement unlock, BTD rights,
authorized delivery, no parallel authority, and locked source-bearing delivery
before settlement and rights transfer. The deterministic source-safe proof
artifact is `.bitcode/v39-interface-conversation-product-parity.json`,
checked by `pnpm run check:v39-gate9`.

### Gate 10: Local And Staging Commercial Reading Rehearsal

Gate 10 proves V39 locally and in staging-testnet.
It must run the five-step Reading flow with real non-mocked inference where credentials are available, Depository search, source-safe preview, telemetry streaming/readback, ledger/database/storage synchronization, PR delivery posture, and blocked production-mainnet value-bearing admission.

The package-owned closure type is `ReadingLocalStagingRehearsal` in
`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/reading-local-staging-rehearsal.ts`. It
binds the local and staging-testnet lanes to the five Reading stages:
request read, review synthesized Need, request Finding Fits, review
source-safe AssetPack preview, and buy/settle. The rehearsal composes
`ReadNeedReviewResynthesisRuntime`, `ReadFitsFindingRuntime`,
`AssetPackPreviewBoundary`, `AssetPackSettlementRightsDeliveryBoundary`,
`ReadingOperationalTelemetryRepairReadback`, and
`ReadingInterfaceProductParity` by proof root and stores source-safe rows
under `reading/rehearsal`.

The staging-testnet lane is explicitly anchored to Supabase project
`tkpyosihuouusyaxtbau` and REST host
`https://tkpyosihuouusyaxtbau.supabase.co/rest/v1/`. Local and staging
rehearsals may use untracked env files or host-provided runtime credentials,
but generated artifacts, stream summaries, and storage projections must never
serialize credentials, protected source, raw protected prompts, raw
interpolated prompts, raw provider responses, unpaid AssetPack source, wallet
private material, private settlement payloads, or live log payloads.
Source-bearing pull-request delivery remains visible only after settlement
and BTD rights transfer; value-bearing mainnet admission remains false. The
deterministic source-safe proof artifact is
`.bitcode/v39-local-staging-reading-rehearsal.json`, checked by
`pnpm run check:v39-gate10`.

### Gate 11: V39 Promotion Readiness

Gate 11 closes V39 with promotion readiness.
It must generate V39 proof support, validate every V39 artifact, update promotion workflows, preserve V38 active / V39 draft to V39 active / draft V40 posture, and block promotion if Depository supply, Reading UX, Need review, Finding Fits, preview/quote, settlement/delivery, telemetry/repair, interface parity, local/staging rehearsal, or source-safety evidence is incomplete.

## V39 non-goals

- V39 does not change BTD supply law, Bitcoin settlement law, Exchange law, or production-mainnet admission unless a later promoted canon explicitly does so.
- V39 does not introduce versioned routes, versioned API paths, or versioned source identifiers.
- V39 does not allow protected source, raw protected prompts, raw provider responses, unpaid AssetPack source, credentials, private wallet material, or private settlement payloads to appear in public telemetry.
- V39 does not replace the existing prompt, registry, execution, agent, tool, and pipeline primitives with a parallel abstraction stack.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode is the commercial Protocol implementation for depositing, measuring, finding, synthesizing, settling, delivering, and proving technical intelligence as BTD and AssetPack activity.
V39 does not replace V38 canon; it deepens the inference machinery that lets Bitcode understand Read Requests, synthesize Needs, find many fits across the Depository, synthesize source-safe AssetPack previews, and deliver full AssetPacks only after settlement and rights transfer.

## source-of-truth hierarchy

The source-of-truth hierarchy for V39 is:

1. `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to active V38 until V39 promotion.
2. `BITCODE_SPEC_V38.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V38_PROVEN.md` remain active canon.
3. `BITCODE_SPEC_V39.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_PARITY_MATRIX.md` are the draft target family during V39 gates.
4. Package source, tests, scripts, workflows, generated `.bitcode/*` artifacts, local/staging rehearsal evidence, and promotion checks must converge before V39 promotion.

## full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V39 work must preserve full-system auditability.
No implementation may bypass package-owned primitives for executions, pipelines, PTRR agents, prompt registries, tools, telemetry, BTD, ledger/database synchronization, object storage, or source-safe disclosure.
Any re-implementation must prove parity against the active primitive and may not fork an easier parallel path.

## totality and precision enforcement rule

V39 gates must make every inference edge total enough to audit: inputs, prompts, PromptParts, interpolation bindings, tools, outputs, raw provider responses, parsed typed results, schema verdicts, repairs, failures, storage destinations, streaming destinations, proof roots, and disclosure tiers must be precise before promotion.

## system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals: commercial inference correctness, reliable Reading intelligence, benchmarkable prompt materials, source-safe telemetry, depository-wide fit-finding, and settlement-traceable AssetPack synthesis.
Non-goals: value-bearing mainnet admission, BTD supply changes, bridge chain-of-record implementation, versioned routes, or provider-specific shortcuts without tests.
Design principles: reuse primitives, preserve typed receipts, fail closed, expose only permitted disclosure tiers, and make every prompt and search decision auditable.

## system architecture and layer boundaries

The V39 architecture boundary is `PipelineExecution -> PTRR agent -> PTRR step -> FailsafeGenerationSequence -> ThricifiedGeneration -> provider call`.
`ToolExecution` remains step-owned.
Prompt registry and PromptPart composition must flow downward from phase, agent, step, Failsafe, tool documentation, and generation prompt materials into the final provider call.
Ledger, wallet, object storage, GitHub delivery, and settlement operations remain outside inference authority and are invoked only through their existing package or route boundaries.

## canonical domain model

The V39 domain model carries the existing Bitcode objects: deposits, Reads, Read Requests, Needs, candidate fit deposits, AssetPacks, BTD ranges, preview measurements, settlement receipts, delivery receipts, proof roots, execution receipts, prompt receipts, tool receipts, telemetry events, and repair cases.
V39 adds no new chain-of-record object; it makes inference and fit-finding receipts precise enough to support the existing Protocol model.

## whole Bitcode operator chain

The whole operator chain is deposit source, measure deposited material, request a Read, synthesize a Need, review or resynthesize the Need, find many fitting deposits, synthesize a source-safe AssetPack preview, calculate deterministic settlement posture, settle in BTC when admitted, transfer BTD read rights, deliver the full AssetPack, journal database/ledger/object-storage projections, emit telemetry, and preserve proof roots for repair.

## canonical subsystem surfaces

### Depositing and asset supply

Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: deposits, deposited source metadata, BTD range identity, source-safe proofs, and inherited `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json` style artifact roots.
Current algorithms and derivation rules: source measurement, source-to-shares accounting, deposit admissibility, and proof-root derivation remain inherited from V38 and prior canon.

## generated canon

Generated canon for V39 includes source-safe `.bitcode/v39-*` artifacts, generated reports, benchmark reports, rehearsal evidence, and the eventual `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_PROVEN.md`.
Generated artifacts must be reproducible, deterministic where possible, and blocked when source-safe payload rules fail.
Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts remain the baseline for deterministic generated proof.
Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts remain the baseline for operator-visible quality.
Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix includes `.bitcode/v39-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v39-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v39-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, `.bitcode/v39-inference-surface-inventory.json`, `.bitcode/v39-ptrr-failsafe-thricified-stack.json`, `.bitcode/v39-prompt-benchmark-report.json`, `.bitcode/v39-disclosure-boundary-report.json`, and later `.bitcode/v39-*` gate artifacts.
V39 specifying generated artifacts include inference inventory, prompt benchmark, telemetry disclosure, depository search, AssetPack handoff, rehearsal, and promotion readiness reports.
Shared generated-artifact fields: version, currentTarget, artifactRoot, sourceRoots, proofRoots, disclosureTier, generatedAt, and command.
Artifact-specific generated payload fields: prompt ids, PromptPart ids, phase ids, agent ids, step ids, Failsafe ids, ThricifiedGeneration ids, tool ids, fit ids, ranking roots, and settlement roots.
Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy: public, source-safe, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, operator-only, and forbidden.

## validation canon

Validation canon includes `pnpm run check:v39-gate1`, `pnpm run check:v39-gate2`, `pnpm run check:v39-gate3`, `pnpm run check:v39-gate4`, `pnpm run check:v39-gate5`, later V39 gate checks, `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V39 --mode draft --current-target V38`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V38`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V38 --draft-target V39`, package tests, route tests, UI tests, prompt benchmark checks, telemetry redaction checks, and local/staging rehearsal checks.

## promotion canon

Promotion canon requires all V39 gates to close, V39 proof support to exist, a V39 promotion workflow to pass, and the promotion commit to change only accepted canon artifacts and the `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer from V38 to V39.
The V39 promotion readiness canon is `.bitcode/v39-promotion-readiness-report.json`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_PROVEN.md`, `v39-canon-promotion.yml`, `check:v39-gate11`, `node scripts/promote-bitcode-canon.mjs --version V39 --commit HEAD --dry-run`, and the V39 active / draft V40 posture checks.

## appendices and canonical supporting material

The appendices below are canonical supporting material for V39 gate work.

The generated appendix must include aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when generated proof evidence is stale, missing, or unsafe.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture require V39 scripts to regenerate artifacts deterministically and fail closed on missing source roots, missing prompt ids, missing schema verdicts, unsafe telemetry payloads, stale proof-source commit, or mismatched canonical pointer.

## Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

V39 validation begins with `check:v39-gate1` and expands through Gate 11.
Gate checks must be scriptable, workflow-wired, source-safe, and specific enough to identify the missing source or artifact.

## Appendix E. Current canonical source map

Current source map roots include `packages/agent-generics`, `packages/prompts`, `packages/tools-generics`, `packages/pipelines/asset-pack`, `packages/protocol`, `packages/api`, `uapi`, `.github/workflows`, `scripts`, and `protocol-demonstration` as a standalone minimal witness.

## Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

Subsystem totality coverage includes repo supply and depositing, reading and measured demand, prompt/inference/evaluator ownership, deposit-to-read fit, recall and ranking, verification decisions, selection and materialization, branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence, identity, authority, signing, and policy, sensitive data and confidentiality flows, projection, disclosure, and redaction, proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay, settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting, telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics, host/runtime capability truth, operator experience and pedagogy, validation and test stack, generated artifacts and canonical promotion.

Promotion may update `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` only after all gates close and promotion validation succeeds.

## Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces include Terminal, Conversations, API, MCP API, ChatGPT App, Auxillaries, Exchange, generated proof reports, dashboards, runbooks, and local/staging rehearsal surfaces.
V39 operator quality requires collapsed readable state and expanded source-safe detail for the full Reading product path, including pipeline telemetry, preview/quote posture, settlement, rights, delivery, and repair.

## Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

Scenario and workflow coverage includes auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch, context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, and Valuable workflows.

## Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

Fail-closed conditions include invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, and stale promoted status truth.

Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contracts include `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_PROVEN.md`.
V39 may expose only source-safe preview metadata before settlement.

## accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

Accepted boundaries: V39 can harden inference, prompt benchmarking, search, telemetry, and traceability; V39 cannot change BTD supply law, route versioning discipline, mainnet admission, or settlement finality law without explicit later promotion.
Reopen conditions: evidence of prompt leakage, inference bypassing primitives, untraceable fit selection, unsafe telemetry, broken depository search, or stale generated proof.

## completion condition

V39 is complete only when every V39 gate is implemented, specified, tested, documented, generated, workflow-wired, source-safe, locally/staging rehearsed where applicable, and promotion-ready with `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_PROVEN.md` support.
