# Bitcode Spec V33 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V33`
- V33 state: canonical promotion complete; V33 parity truth, generated interface artifacts, gate closure, and promotion automation are aligned
- Current canonical/latest target: `V33`
- Canonical proof-source commit: `6c3cc76c4a41bdbaf02c78334b3cd9c6fa3554b6`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V32.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V32_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: active canonical `.bitcode/v33-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v33-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v33-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, `.bitcode/v33-interface-contract-catalog.json`, `.bitcode/v33-mcp-api-tool-contracts.json`, `.bitcode/v33-chatgpt-app-action-contracts.json`, `.bitcode/v33-interface-authorization-policy.json`, `.bitcode/v33-read-license-assetpack-rights-contracts.json`, `.bitcode/v33-api-schema-compatibility-matrix.json`, `.bitcode/v33-interface-telemetry-proof-hooks.json`, `.bitcode/v33-interface-consumer-ux-regression-proof.json`, `.bitcode/v33-promotion-readiness-report.json`, V33 gate-quality and promotion workflow evidence, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_PROVEN.md` as the generated proof appendix for V33 promotion
- Source parity state: V33 source-side interface contract catalog, MCP tool contracts, ChatGPT App action contracts, authorization policy, Read license and AssetPack rights contracts, API schema compatibility matrix, interface telemetry proof hooks, consumer UX regression proof, workflow, and promotion surfaces are canonicalized in the promoted V33 file family
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_PROVEN.md` only after V33 promotion
- Scope: V33 canonical parity ledger for commercial interface depth over promoted V32 proof/testing canon
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V33`

## Purpose

The V33 parity matrix prevents interface work from becoming a set of local adapters.
Every V33 gate must name the package-owned contract, interface surface, schema, auth policy, source-safety class, example fixture, compatibility row, telemetry/proof hook, validation command, and failure or repair posture required for closure.

## V33 accepted boundaries

- V33 owns interface-depth and interface-owned proof hooks.
- V34 owns deployment, host capability, distributed execution, environment lanes, rollback, upgrades, and secret rotation.
- V35 owns broad telemetry/documentation programs, dashboards, docs, incidents, operator guides, and rollout material.
- V36 owns deeper Exchange.
- V37 owns website Conversations.
- V33 does not authorize value-bearing production-mainnet launch.
- V33 does not expose protected AssetPack source before settlement through any interface.

## V33 completion condition

V33 is complete when all ten V33 gates are closed, source-safe interface contracts are package-owned and tested, MCP API and ChatGPT App behavior matches public API and Terminal handoff contracts, interface authorization and rights denials fail closed, schema compatibility evidence is generated, interface telemetry proof hooks replay to ledger/database/object-storage truth, and V33 promotion can generate `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_PROVEN.md` plus source-safe `.bitcode/v33-*` artifacts.
