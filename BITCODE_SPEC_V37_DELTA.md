## Why V37 exists

V36 promoted Exchange depth.
That made Bitcode's market surface auditable enough for market-wide activity, rights-transfer review, pricing, settlement, repair, revenue route, and Exchange UX.

V37 exists because Bitcode now needs website Conversations to become a first-class enterprise experience instead of deferred interface posture.
Conversations must let enterprise users draft requests, stream assistant work, select source context, move into Terminal transactions, and preserve route-local history while reusing Protocol, Reading, BTD, Exchange, telemetry, and documentation truth.

## Accepted V37 decisions

- V36 remains active canon during V37 drafting.
- V37 gate branches are opened from `version/v37` and merged back only when their gate acceptance criteria are closed.
- V37 owns Website Conversations: conversation sessions, messages, stream events, fullscreen writing mode, source selectors, route-local history, Terminal handoff, persistence/privacy, telemetry/proof hooks, and local/staging rehearsal.
- Conversations contracts must be package-owned before they are exposed by route handlers, UI state, dashboards, runbooks, MCP tools, ChatGPT App actions, public docs, or generated artifacts.
- Conversations previews and streams disclose source-safe summaries, roots, rights posture, source selector metadata, handoff state, retry state, and denial reasons; they must not disclose protected source, raw protected prompts, wallet private material, secrets, or unpaid AssetPack contents.
- Terminal remains the transaction cockpit; Conversations can prepare and hand off transaction intent but must not become a parallel ledger, wallet, settlement, Exchange, or Reading authority.

## Explicitly deferred

- Post-V37 work owns any production-mainnet admission, bridge chain-of-record implementation, and future non-website conversation surfaces not covered by V37.
- Production-mainnet value-bearing launch remains explicitly blocked until a future promoted canon admits it.
- Bridge chain-of-record implementation remains out of V37.
- V37 does not reopen BTD supply law, Reading pipeline product law, V34 deployment law, V35 telemetry/docs law, V36 Exchange law, or AssetPack source disclosure law.

## Pre-Implementation Sequence

1. Open `version/v37` from promoted `main`.
2. Open `v37/gate-1-conversations-roadmap-opening` from `version/v37`.
3. Create the V37 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY family while preserving `BITCODE_SPEC.txt -> V36`.
4. Refresh `SPECIFICATIONS_ROADMAP.md` so V36 is active canon, V37 is draft target, and post-V37 scope remains coherent.
5. Retarget gate-quality and canon-quality workflow posture checks to V36 active / V37 draft.
6. Add `check:v37-gate1` and a V37 Gate 1 checker.
7. Define V37 gates, acceptance criteria, carryforward parity rows, and post-V37 roadmap responsibilities.
8. Validate spec family, canonical inputs, canon posture, workflows, roadmap truth, README/docs, and diff hygiene.
9. Push the gate branch and open a pull request to `version/v37`.

## Commit-Body Direction

V37 gate commit bodies should describe the closed gate, specification changes, implementation surfaces, tests, proof commands, and accepted boundaries.
The eventual V37 promotion commit body must name all closed V37 gates, generated Conversations proof artifacts, stream and handoff evidence, UI proof, public/internal documentation evidence, telemetry/runbook evidence, local/staging rehearsal proof, and the `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer change from `V36` to `V37`.
It must explicitly defer bridge chain-of-record implementation, value-bearing mainnet launch, and non-website conversation surfaces outside V37.

## Gate Delta
