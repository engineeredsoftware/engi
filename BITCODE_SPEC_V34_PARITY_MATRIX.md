# Bitcode Spec V34 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V34`
- V34 state: Gate 8 rollback, upgrade, and data repair playbooks are closed over promoted V33 canon
- Current canonical/latest target: `V33`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: draft V34 specifying artifacts `.bitcode/v34-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v34-canonical-input-report.json`, Gate 2 artifacts `.bitcode/v34-deployment-host-capability-catalog.json` and `.bitcode/v34-environment-lane-contracts.json`, Gate 3 artifact `.bitcode/v34-distributed-execution-runtime-receipts.json`, Gate 4 artifact `.bitcode/v34-deployment-storage-posture.json`, Gate 5 artifact `.bitcode/v34-secret-rotation-boundary-operations.json`, Gate 6 artifact `.bitcode/v34-migration-cicd-approval-gates.json`, Gate 7 artifact `.bitcode/v34-runtime-observers-broadcasters-repair-jobs.json`, Gate 8 artifact `.bitcode/v34-rollback-upgrade-data-repair-playbooks.json`, and later deployment-depth artifacts as gates close
- Source parity state: Gate 8 closes host capability, environment lane, distributed execution runtime receipt, storage posture, secret rotation, migration CI/CD approval, runtime observer/broadcaster/repair-job parity, and rollback/upgrade/data repair playbook parity; Gates 9 through 10 remain draft-required deployment-depth parity rows
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V34.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PROVEN.md` only after V34 promotion
- Scope: V34 draft parity ledger for deployment depth over promoted V33 commercial interface canon
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V33`

## Purpose

The V34 parity matrix prevents deployment work from becoming dashboard-only assumptions or environment folklore.
Every V34 gate must name the package-owned deployment object, runtime host, environment lane, storage carrier, secret boundary, runtime receipt, approval gate, repair posture, generated artifact, validation command, and source-safe proof required for closure.

| Local and staging-testnet deployment rehearsal | Gate 9 | planned rehearsal artifacts, source-safe logs, screenshots, and `check:v34-gate9` | draft-required | Local and staging-testnet rehearsals exercise commercial runtime without value-bearing mainnet admission. |
| Promotion readiness | Gate 10 | planned promotion readiness report, promotion script support, generated appendix support, and `check:v34-gate10` | draft-required | V34 can promote only after all deployment gates pass and generated canon is source-safe. |

## V34 accepted boundaries

- V34 owns deployment-depth and deployment-owned proof hooks.
- V35 owns broad telemetry/documentation programs, dashboards, docs, incidents, operator guides, and rollout material.
- V36 owns deeper Exchange.
- V37 owns website Conversations.
- V34 does not authorize value-bearing production-mainnet launch.
- V34 does not expose protected AssetPack source before settlement through any runtime carrier, generated proof, log, or interface.

## V34 completion condition

V34 parity is complete when each deployment-depth gate row has source evidence, tests, generated artifacts where required, workflow/checker support, and closed parity judgment, and when V34 promotion can rewrite `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` from `V33` to `V34` only after promotion-grade validations pass.
