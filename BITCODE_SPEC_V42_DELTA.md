# Bitcode Spec V42 Delta

## Status

- Version: `V42`
- V42 state: draft opened; this delta records the planned V41-to-V42 reliable MVP experience work
- Current canonical/latest target: `V41`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V41.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V41_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: draft `.bitcode/v42-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v42-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v42-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, and later V42 gate artifacts for Depositing, Reading, Finding Fits, settlement/delivery, AI-reading demonstration, local/staging rehearsal, and promotion readiness
- Source parity state: V42 source parity is opened by Gate 1 and remains incomplete until later gates implement the product paths
- Scope: V42 draft delta for reliable MVP product experience over promoted V41 prompt-program excellence canon

## Why V42 exists

V42 turns the promoted V39 Reading product, V40 testing depth, and V41 prompt-program excellence into a reliable MVP enterprise experience.
The version focuses on shortest-path Depositing, shortest-path Reading, settlement-gated AssetPack delivery, depositor compensation visibility, and an AI-reading dominant demonstration that proves AssetPacks improve an AI system beyond public-data-only baseline performance.

## Accepted V42 decisions

- V42 starts from active `V41` canon and keeps `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` at `V41` until promotion.
- V42 product work stays unversioned in source paths.
- Depositing must minimize the path to Depository admission proof and future compensation visibility.
- Reading must use five product steps: request read, review synthesized Need, request Finding Fits, review source-safe AssetPack preview, and buy/settle/deliver AssetPack.
- `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` remain the formal Reading pipeline names.
- Source-bearing AssetPack content remains withheld until BTC settlement, BTD rights transfer, and storage/delivery reconciliation.
- The demonstration remains self-contained in `protocol-demonstration/` and must prove AI-reading value without importing commercial code.

## V42 gate plan

### Gate 1: MVP Experience Roadmap And Spec Opening

Open the V42 full specification family, roadmap, package script, workflow posture, documentation posture, branch convention, and checker.

### Gate 2: Depositing Shortest Path And Compensation Visibility

Implement and prove the shortest path from source material to Depository admission proof and later compensation readback.
Gate 2 now binds Depository admission proof to a source-safe compensation route preview, route/API readiness, Depository search documents, vector/storage projection, source-to-shares readback keys, Terminal activity/history/readback fields, and `.bitcode/v42-depositing-shortest-path.json`.
The compensation preview is deliberately pre-mint: it records BTC/source-to-shares eligibility if the deposit is selected into a later paid AssetPack, but it does not mint BTD, transfer rights, expose source, or allocate BTC before accepted Need-Fit and settlement.

### Gate 3: Reading Shortest Path State Machine

Implement and prove the five-step Reading product state machine with low-detail defaults and expandable proof/telemetry detail.
Gate 3 now binds route-owned Reading state to transaction recovery, `readingStage` route hydration, retry/restart posture, source-safe failure repair, accepted-Need blockers, source-safe preview blockers, rich execution stream readback, and `.bitcode/v42-reading-shortest-path-state-machine.json`.
The state machine keeps Terminal guided by default while preserving proof-on-expand detail for operators.

### Gate 4: ReadNeed Review And Resynthesis Product Closure

Implement and prove reviewed synthesized Need flow, feedback/resynthesis, accepted-Need admission, storage projection, telemetry, and UI readback.
Gate 4 now binds `ReadNeedReviewResynthesisRuntime` (`readNeedReviewRuntime` route payloads), all four ReadNeed actions, source-safe storage projection, accepted and rejected review states, PTRR/Failsafe/Thricified telemetry receipts, Terminal runtime/storage/telemetry readback, `.bitcode/v42-readneed-review-resynthesis-product-closure.json`, and `check:v42-gate4`.

### Gate 5: ReadFitsFinding AssetPack Preview And Quote Closure

Implement and prove many-candidate Depository search, selected-fit provenance, source-safe AssetPack preview, deterministic BTD/BTC quote, and no pre-settlement source leakage.
Gate 5 now binds `ReadFitsFindingRuntime`, many-channel Depository search, `AssetPackPreviewBoundary`, quote receipt readback, selected-fit provenance, settlement instructions, delivery posture, harness evidence summaries, Terminal preview/quote/provenance rows, `.bitcode/v42-readfitsfinding-preview-quote.json`, and `check:v42-gate5`.

### Gate 6: Settlement Rights Transfer And Repository Delivery Closure

Implement and prove purchase, settlement observation, BTD rights transfer, source unlock, repository pull request delivery, compensation accounting, and repair posture.
Gate 6 now binds settlement rights transfer through `AssetPackSettlementRightsDeliveryBoundary` to the live harness, route summary, Terminal readback, source-to-shares conservation, BTD read/right receipts, and ledger/database/object-storage reconciliation through `.bitcode/v42-settlement-rights-delivery.json`.

### Gate 7: AI-Reading Dominant Demonstration MVP

Implement and prove the standalone demonstration where deposited technical intelligence improves an AI system beyond a public-data-only baseline.

### Gate 8: Local And Staging-Testnet Full MVP Rehearsal

Run and prove the complete MVP path locally and in staging-testnet with value-bearing mainnet blocked.

### Gate 9: V42 Promotion Readiness

Bind every V42 product artifact, workflow, generated proof, promotion command, source-safety result, and active V42 / draft V43 runtime posture.

## Explicitly deferred

- V43+ agentic deposit AssetPack option synthesis remains deferred.
- `/terminal` is not split into `/read` and `/deposit` during V42.
- `/exchange` is not renamed to `/packs` during V42.
- V43+ must take the route-vocabulary cleanup seriously: `/packs` replaces Exchange as the searchable master-detail activity route, while `/read` and `/deposit` become the short core paths for buying and selling AssetPacks.
- Production-mainnet value-bearing operation remains blocked unless a later promoted canon explicitly admits it.
- V42 Gate 1 does not change route behavior, pipeline behavior, settlement behavior, or demonstration behavior.

## Pre-Implementation Sequence

1. Open `version/v42` and `v42/gate-1-mvp-experience-roadmap-opening`.
2. Keep `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` at `V41`.
3. Add the V42 spec family and Gate 1 checker.
4. Update roadmap, docs, package scripts, and workflows for active V41 / draft V42.
5. Validate V42 draft family and V41 active posture.

## Commit-Body Direction

V42 commits should name the product path, protocol object, pipeline or route ownership, source-safety boundary, generated artifact or checker, and tests run.
