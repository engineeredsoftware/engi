# Bitcode Spec V43 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V43`
- V43 state: canonical promotion complete; V43 parity truth, generated product-route artifacts, gate closure, and promotion automation are aligned
- Current canonical/latest target: `V43`
- Canonical proof-source commit: `3c7a9f998656635cc28c8b4584ae964ac04154fa`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V42.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: active canonical `.bitcode/v43-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v43-canonical-input-report.json`, `.bitcode/v43-canon-posture-drift-report.json`, `.bitcode/v43-route-vocabulary-inventory.json`, `.bitcode/v43-packs-activity-master-detail.json`, `.bitcode/v43-read-route-five-step-ux.json`, `.bitcode/v43-deposit-route-options.json`, `.bitcode/v43-deposit-policy-compensation.json`, `.bitcode/v43-deposit-option-admission.json`, `.bitcode/v43-route-ux-product-excellence.json`, `.bitcode/v43-cross-route-rehearsal-telemetry-repair.json`, `.bitcode/v43-promotion-readiness-report.json`, V43 gate-quality and promotion workflow evidence, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V43_PROVEN.md` as the generated proof appendix for V43 promotion
- Source parity state: V43 source-side route vocabulary, Packs master-detail, Read five-step UX, deposit option synthesis, deposit policy/compensation, deposit option admission, route UX, cross-route rehearsal, workflow, and promotion surfaces are canonicalized in the promoted V43 file family
- Scope: V43 canonical parity ledger for product routes and agentic depositing over promoted V42 reliable MVP canon
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V43`

## Purpose

This matrix tracks V43 parity from product-route specification through source implementation, tests, generated artifacts, and promotion readiness.

## Audit basis

Audit V43 against `BITCODE_SPEC_V43.md`, V42 active canon, route source, package source, generated artifacts, workflow checks, and local/staging rehearsal receipts.

## Gate 10 Promotion readiness parity

V43 Gate 10 is closed when `.bitcode/v43-promotion-readiness-report.json`
covers every V43 gate artifact, generated proof output, workflow, promotion
script, package export, protocol test, documentation evidence, source-safety
boundary, and active V43 / draft V44 post-promotion posture. The readiness
artifact is source-safe metadata only and keeps value-bearing mainnet blocked.

## V43 accepted boundaries

Gate 1 is allowed to specify and wire validation posture only. Gate 2 is allowed
to inventory and plan migration only. Gate 3 may implement `/packs`,
PackActivity, and `/exchange` compatibility redirect only. It must not extract
`/read`, extract `/deposit`, or add deposit option synthesis behavior before
their owning implementation gates. Gate 5 may implement `/deposit` and
source-safe option synthesis. Gate 6 may decide source-safe criticality, demand,
ROI, BTD potential, and compensation posture, but it must not approve, admit,
index, store, or synchronize deposit AssetPacks into `/packs`; those remain Gate
7 responsibilities. Gate 7 may approve, reject, request resynthesis, admit
policy-eligible options, project source-safe index/storage metadata, and
synchronize admitted options into `/packs`; it must not mint BTD, transfer
rights, broadcast settlement, or disclose unpaid AssetPack source.
Gate 8 may refine route layout, concise copy, shared components, accessible
step controls, progressive detail, and loading/empty/error states, but it must
not move state-machine authority, change settlement law, or disclose protected
source.
Gate 9 may bind the local/staging-testnet route path, source-safe operator
receipts, telemetry/database readback, ledger/database/storage synchronization,
and repair posture. It must not serialize live secrets, protected source,
unpaid AssetPack source, raw prompts, provider responses, private wallet
material, private settlement payloads, or live rehearsal logs, and it must not
admit value-bearing mainnet execution.

## V43 completion condition

The matrix is complete when every V43 gate row is closed with source, tests, documentation, generated artifacts, and promotion proof.
