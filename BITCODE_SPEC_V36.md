## Version executive summary

V36 is the Exchange-depth version.
It opens Bitcode's market surface after the Terminal, Reading, BTD, interface, deployment, telemetry, and documentation spine has been promoted through V35.
V36 turns Exchange from deferred commercial posture into auditable product law for market-wide activity, buy and sell intent, bid and ask flows, cancel and accept paths, settlement history, AssetPack range trading, BTD rights-transfer review, pricing and liquidity analysis, dispute repair, revenue routing, and Exchange-specific validation.

V36 closes only when Exchange can expose a source-safe, proof-rooted, ledger-synchronized market experience without weakening Bitcode's non-fungible BTD source-share law, BTC fee separation, AssetPack disclosure boundary, paid read/right transfer, or value-bearing mainnet block.

## V36 Exchange spine

V36 adds Exchange contract objects over inherited V35 canon:

- `ExchangeActivityBook`: market-wide activity master-detail rows, filters, proof roots, redaction posture, source-safety class, and ledger/database projection references.
- `ExchangeIntent`: buy, sell, bid, ask, cancel, accept, settle, and history intent envelopes with principal, authority, policy, source-safe preview, and failure posture.
- `ExchangeOrder`: order state for BTD range or AssetPack rights transfer without fungibilizing the underlying source-share cells.
- `ExchangeRightsTransferPreview`: source-safe rights-transfer review, buyer/depositor authority posture, current owner, range identity, settlement quote root, and disclosure limit.
- `ExchangePricingQuote`: deterministic price, fee, volume, measurement-weight, liquidity, wrapper, and BTC settlement analysis.
- `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`: ledger/database/object-storage synchronized settlement and finality receipt for market activity.
- `ExchangeDisputeRepairCase`: dispute, projection drift, underpayment, overpayment, cancelled-order replay, stale ownership, and failed delivery repair posture.
- `ExchangeRevenueRoute`: depositor, reader, treasury, fee, and revenue accounting route that preserves BTC fee separation and BTD range identity.

V36 does not replace V35 telemetry/documentation contracts.
It extends them so Exchange events, dashboards, public docs, operator runbooks, and incident paths derive from package-owned market contracts.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode measures technical knowledge, finds deposits that fit reviewed Reads, synthesizes source-bearing AssetPacks, and settles read rights in BTC with BTD range and rights receipts.
The active V35 canon remains:

- Deposits supply source material to the Bitcode depository.
- A Read Request is synthesized into a reviewed ReadNeed by `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis`.
- `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` searches for plural threshold-passing fit deposits and synthesizes source-safe AssetPack preview records.
- Protected AssetPack source remains hidden before paid settlement.
- BTC is the fee asset and BTD range/read-license/right transfer is ledgerized.
- Paid settlement unlocks full AssetPack delivery, including pull-request delivery where applicable.
- Telemetry, documentation, dashboards, runbooks, docs QA, and rollout guides remain source-safe and proof-rooted.

V36 adds a market layer for existing BTD and AssetPack rights.
Exchange may list, quote, bid, ask, accept, cancel, settle, and repair rights-transfer activity, but it must not make BTD cells fungible, leak protected source, bypass paid settlement, or treat database projections as stronger than ledger truth.

## V36 source-of-truth hierarchy

The V36 source-of-truth hierarchy is:

1. `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`, which remains `V35` until V36 promotion.
2. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36.md` during V36 drafting.
3. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_NOTES.md`.
4. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_DELTA.md`.
5. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PARITY_MATRIX.md`.
6. generated V36 artifacts under `.bitcode/` when produced.
7. `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md` only after promotion.
8. source implementation, tests, public docs, internal docs, telemetry definitions, and QA evidence that realize this family.

Older specifications are provenance only.
They must not become hidden current-system law.

## V36 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V36 must be re-implementable and auditable from its specification family without reading conversation history.
Every Exchange activity row, order state, intent envelope, pricing quote, rights-transfer preview, settlement receipt, dispute case, repair operation, revenue route, UI state, API payload, telemetry event, proof root, and generated artifact must identify:

- canonical object;
- required inputs;
- outputs and stored artifacts;
- deterministic, inferred, external, ledger-derived, or policy-derived fields;
- proof obligations;
- failure and repair posture;
- implementation and validation surfaces.

## V36 totality and precision enforcement rule

V36 fails closed when any Exchange behavior lacks explicit ownership, authority, source-safety class, disclosure posture, ledger/database synchronization rule, BTD range identity rule, BTC fee rule, proof root, telemetry event, and repair path.
Each gate must preserve exact abstraction names:

- executions are the base runtime records;
- pipelines compose phase-wise behavior;
- agents are PTRR agents;
- PTRR steps are the four formal agent steps;
- sub-steps are ThricifiedGenerations;
- pipeline inference points are ThricifiedGenerations;
- tools are registry-backed tool calls;
- prompts are prompt-part and prompt-template registry compositions;
- interfaces are contract consumers, not owners of protocol truth;
- Exchange is a product surface over BTD/AssetPack rights, not a replacement tokenomics layer;
- ledger records and journals outrank database projections for settlement and ownership truth.

No source identifier may introduce a versioned route, gate, or work-in-progress name unless explicitly accepted as a bounded compatibility artifact.

## V36 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- define Exchange market-wide activity master-detail contracts;
- define buy, sell, bid, ask, cancel, accept, settle, and history flows;
- define AssetPack range trading and BTD rights-transfer review without source leakage;
- define deterministic pricing, liquidity, fee quote, wrapper, and measurement-weight analysis;
- define ledger/database/object-storage reconciliation for Exchange settlement;
- define dispute, repair, and revenue-route operations specific to market activity;
- integrate Exchange with Terminal navigation, public docs, telemetry, dashboards, runbooks, and local/staging rehearsal.

Non-goals:

- no new BTD supply or tokenomics law;
- no fungible wrapper as chain-of-record for non-fungible source-share cells;
- no bridge chain-of-record implementation;
- no website Conversations product-depth implementation;
- no rewrite of `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` or `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis`;
- no exposure of protected AssetPack source before settlement;
- no value-bearing production-mainnet approval.

Design principles:

- source-safe preview before market action;
- ledger-derived ownership before database convenience;
- deterministic price and fee roots before UI totals;
- cancel and repair paths before optimistic settlement display;
- revenue routing before operator dashboard polish;
- public Exchange documentation discloses market posture and rights boundaries, not protected source.

## V36 system architecture and layer boundaries

V36 preserves the V35 architecture and adds Exchange ownership:

- `packages/protocol` owns canon posture, spec-family checks, generated-proof helpers, Exchange proof helper APIs, and promotion-governance helper APIs.
- `packages/btd` owns BTD range identity, read-license, rights transfer, wallet capability, fee posture, settlement, access policy, reconciliation primitives, and value-lane admission boundaries.
- `packages/api` owns JSON-safe reusable route contracts over package primitives and must expose Exchange posture only through source-safe schemas.
- `packages/pipelines/asset-pack` owns Reading pipeline contracts and source-safe preview outputs; Exchange may reference settled AssetPack rights but must not redefine Reading law.
- `packages/executions-mcp` owns MCP server contracts and tool exposure; Exchange MCP exposure must derive from package-owned contracts.
- `packages/chatgptapp` owns ChatGPT App action contracts and source-safe response rendering.
- `uapi` owns commercial product routes and user interfaces, including `/exchange`, but not protocol truth or settlement law.
- `protocol-demonstration` remains a standalone minimal reference and proof witness outside the workspace import graph.
- deployment host services own runtime carriers, queues, observers, broadcasters, repair jobs, object storage, and environment variables through inherited V34/V35 contracts.
- public `/docs` surfaces own enterprise-facing guidance but must derive from protocol/package truth.

Layer boundaries:

- Commercial interfaces may call commercial APIs and packages; they must not import demonstration runtime code.
- Exchange may show source-safe market, proof, fee, and rights-transfer metadata before settlement; it must not show protected AssetPack source before payment and rights transfer.
- Ledger records and journals are source-of-truth for settlement/finality; Supabase/PostgreSQL projections must not contradict them.
- Object storage carries source-bearing AssetPacks, proof bundles, generated artifacts, and rollback material only under explicit disclosure and retention policy.
- Value-bearing mainnet activity is blocked until a future canon admits it; V36 may define readiness and dry-run proof, not production value launch.

## V36 proof/test package API and inherited support canon

V36 treats package APIs as the source of Exchange truth.
The formal package boundaries are:

- `@bitcode/protocol` owns active/draft canon posture, generated proof helpers, and V36 Exchange check helpers.
- `@bitcode/btd` owns rights, range, fee, wallet, access, treasury, reconciliation, and value-lane admission primitives.
- `@bitcode/api` owns reusable JSON contracts for public API consumers and source-safe Exchange posture.
- `@bitcode/pipeline-asset-pack` owns Reading pipeline contract surfaces and source-safe preview outputs that Exchange may reference after settlement.
- MCP and ChatGPT App packages consume those contracts rather than inventing interface-local shapes.

The commercial protocol package owns the active/draft posture while V36 is in flight:

- `ACTIVE_CANON_VERSION = 'V35'`;
- `DRAFT_TARGET_VERSION = 'V36'`;
- spec-family, canonical-input, canon-posture-drift, and proven-generation helpers remain exported through the package index;
- package tests and V36 checks fail closed on direct demonstration-source imports and source-unsafe Exchange output.

Any Exchange object used by more than one runtime lane, interface, package, docs surface, dashboard, or runbook must have a package-owned type, builder, parser, validator, source-safe fixture, example, compatibility row, replay command where relevant, and generated artifact before the gate that depends on it closes.

## V36 canonical domain model

V36 adds Exchange contract objects over V35 protocol and deployment truth:

- `ExchangeActivityBook`: activity id, activity kind, assetPack id, BTD range id, principal ids, state, source-safe summary, proof roots, ledger/database projection refs, event ids, and detail link.
- `ExchangeIntent`: intent id, actor principal, organization role, action kind, target range, quote root, authority proof, policy result, idempotency key, and fail-closed reason.
- `ExchangeOrder`: order id, side, range, AssetPack rights scope, owner posture, price quote, expiration, cancellability, acceptability, settlement state, and repair posture.
- `ExchangeRightsTransferPreview`: source-safe preview of current ownership, requested transfer, price root, fee root, disclosure boundary, settlement unlock condition, and post-settlement delivery condition.
- `ExchangePricingQuote`: BTC amount, measurement weights, measurement volume, liquidity band, wrapper analysis, fee split, treasury route, depositor route, reader route, and deterministic quote root.
- `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`: payment observation, finality state, rights transfer receipt, ledger root, database projection root, object storage root, delivery state, and repair id.
- `ExchangeDisputeRepairCase`: incident class, dispute reason, affected order, affected settlement, affected projection, repair command, verification command, proof root, and escalation path.
- `ExchangeRevenueRoute`: treasury account, depositor account, reader account, fee account, BTC route, BTD right route, source-to-shares route, and conservation proof.

Inherited V35 objects remain active: `Deposit`, `ReadRequest`, `ReadNeed`, `FindingFitsResult`, `AssetPackPreview`, `SettlementUnlock`, `BtcFeeQuote`, `BtdAssetPackMintReceipt`, `BtdReadReceipt`, `BtdRightsTransferReceipt`, `SourceToSharesProof`, `TerminalTransaction`, `TelemetryTaxonomyCatalog`, `DocumentationSurfaceCatalog`, `DocsQaAlignmentReport`, `OperatorRunbookCatalog`, `TestnetRolloutReadinessGuide`, `McpToolContract`, `ChatGptAppActionContract`, `PublicApiRouteContract`, and `InterfaceTelemetryProofHook`.

## V36 gate plan

V36 closes through ten gates:

1. **Gate 1: V36 Exchange Roadmap And Spec Opening** opens the V36 family over V35 canon, updates `SPECIFICATIONS_ROADMAP.md`, documents V35 active / V36 draft posture, and wires `check:v36-gate1`.
2. **Gate 2: Exchange Activity Book And Market Master Detail** defines `ExchangeActivityBook` source-safe rows for market-wide activity, filters, detail panes, proof roots, and telemetry bindings.
3. **Gate 3: Buy Sell Bid Ask Cancel Accept Intent Contracts** defines `ExchangeIntent` and `ExchangeOrder` action envelopes, authorization, idempotency, cancelability, acceptability, and history transitions.
4. **Gate 4: AssetPack Range Trading And Rights Transfer Review** defines BTD range/AssetPack rights-transfer preview, source-safe disclosure, ownership checks, and settlement unlock boundaries.
5. **Gate 5: Pricing Liquidity Fee Quote And Wrapper Analysis** defines deterministic BTC price, measurement-weight, volume, liquidity, wrapper, fee-split, and quote-root calculations.
6. **Gate 6: Exchange Settlement Ledger Database Reconciliation** defines `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`, finality, ledger/database/object-storage synchronization, projection repair, and observer hooks.
7. **Gate 7: Dispute Repair Revenue Route Operations** defines dispute cases, repair jobs, revenue routes, conservation proofs, escalation, and operator runbooks.
8. **Gate 8: Exchange UX And Terminal Navigation Integration** wires Exchange master-detail, Terminal handoff, source-safe review states, public docs, and telemetry dashboards.
9. **Gate 9: Local Staging Exchange Rehearsal And Proof Coverage** rehearses local/staging-testnet Exchange flows with source-safe logs, proof roots, DB/ledger synchronization checks, and blocked value-bearing mainnet posture.
10. **Gate 10: V36 Promotion Readiness** generates V36 Exchange proof artifacts, promotion readiness, active V36 / draft V37 posture, and canonical promotion support.

## V36 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V36 whole-system operator chain is:

1. Depositor deposits source material.
2. Reader requests a Read.
3. `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` synthesizes a reviewed ReadNeed.
4. `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` finds plural fit deposits and synthesizes a source-safe AssetPack preview.
5. Reader pays BTC fee and receives BTD read/right transfer.
6. AssetPack delivery occurs after settlement and rights transfer.
7. Exchange lists eligible BTD range or AssetPack rights only after ownership and disclosure checks pass.
8. Buyer or seller submits source-safe market intent.
9. Exchange quotes price, liquidity, fee, wrapper, and rights-transfer preview.
10. Buyer accepts, cancels, bids, asks, settles, or reviews history through source-safe states.
11. Observers, broadcasters, repair jobs, and storage carriers reconcile settlement, finality, rights, delivery, and proof state through inherited V34/V35 deployment and telemetry law.

## V36 canonical subsystem surfaces

### Depositing and asset supply

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: `Deposit`, depository records, owner authority, source-to-shares proof, and Exchange eligibility metadata.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: deposited source is measured and rights-bearing only through inherited Reading and BTD law before it can become Exchange-eligible.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: invalid deposit, missing ownership, revoked policy, or protected source leakage blocks Exchange listing.
- Current proof obligations: source root, owner authority root, BTD range root, and disclosure root.

### Fit, recall, ranking, and verification

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: fit deposits, recall/ranking evidence, verification decisions, AssetPack preview, and rights-transfer eligibility.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: recall and ranking remain Reading functions; Exchange may sort market entries by source-safe measurements and price metadata.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: no-survivor asset pack, stale verification, or ownership mismatch blocks listing and settlement.
- Current proof obligations: fit root, verification root, measurement root, and order eligibility root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: pipeline packages, BTD packages, and API contracts.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: V36 market master-detail and rights-transfer gates.
- Current accepted boundaries: Exchange must not expose fit source or model raw outputs before settlement.

### Selection and materialization

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: selected AssetPack source, delivery branch, object storage root, BTD range root, Exchange order root, and settlement receipt.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: materialization remains post-settlement for protected source; Exchange can preview measurements and roots only.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: unpaid source, missing fee quote, stale settlement, storage drift, delivery mismatch, or order cancellation blocks delivery.
- Current proof obligations: selected source root, object storage root, order root, settlement root, and delivery root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: API, storage, ledger, and delivery services.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: V36 settlement reconciliation and rehearsal gates.
- Current accepted boundaries: source-bearing AssetPack content crosses visibility only after settlement.

### Identity, authorization, and sensitive flow

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: principal, organization role, wallet capability, owner authority, order authorization, and policy decision.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: only authorized owners can list or transfer rights; only authorized buyers can settle.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: authorization denial, stale owner, wallet mismatch, revoked org role, or policy failure blocks Exchange intent.
- Current proof obligations: auth root, wallet root, policy root, role root, and signature root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: BTD, API, Auth, Terminal, Exchange, and Auxillaries packages/routes.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: inherited V31/V33/V35 auth/interface checks plus V36 intent gates.
- Current accepted boundaries: wallet private material and service-role secrets never enter Exchange payloads.

### Disclosure and projection

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: source-safe market preview, rights-transfer preview, disclosure policy, telemetry event, docs link, and redaction proof.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: projections expose market metadata, measurements, proof roots, fee roots, settlement posture, and denial reasons.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: public projection overexposure, protected source leakage, raw protected prompt leakage, or unpaid source exposure blocks the response.
- Current proof obligations: disclosure root, redaction root, docs root, and telemetry root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: UAPI, public docs, protocol contracts, and telemetry taxonomy.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: V35 docs/telemetry checks plus V36 UX and rehearsal checks.

### Settlement and exact accounting

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: `BtcFeeQuote`, `ExchangePricingQuote`, `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`, `BtdRightsTransferReceipt`, journal, ledger root, database projection root, and revenue route.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: BTC fee and BTD rights transfer remain separate but correlated by deterministic roots; measurement weight times measurement volume informs price only through auditable quote rules.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: settlement conservation drift, underpayment, overpayment, stale finality, projection drift, or invalid rights transfer blocks completion.
- Current proof obligations: fee quote root, settlement root, rights transfer root, source-to-shares root, and revenue route root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: `packages/btd`, ledger/database adapters, observers, repair jobs, and API routes.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: V36 pricing and settlement gates.
- Current accepted boundaries: database projection never overrides ledger truth.

### Proof contract, witnesses, and replay

- Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: generated proof appendix, Exchange generated artifacts, proof-family reports, telemetry records, and rehearsal evidence.
- Current algorithms and derivation rules: V36 generated artifacts derive from package-owned builders and fail closed on stale or source-unsafe payloads.
- Current invariants and fail-closed conditions: stale promoted status truth, missing generated artifact, stale proof root, unsupported disclosure, or replay mismatch blocks gate closure.
- Current proof obligations: proof family root, generated artifact root, workflow root, rehearsal root, and promotion root.
- Current source-bearing implementation basis: `packages/protocol`, scripts, workflows, and generated `.bitcode/` artifacts.
- Current validating commands and parity basis: `check:v36-gate1` through `check:v36-gate10`, spec-family checks, canonical-input checks, and canon-posture drift checks.
- Current accepted boundaries: proof artifacts are source-safe unless explicitly private and access-controlled.

## V36 generated canon

V36 generated canon consists of source-safe `.bitcode/` artifacts generated by package-owned builders and checked by scripts.

### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

V36 inherits deterministic replay, volatility, theorem-evidence, proof-member, state-machine, and contract-change artifact expectations.

### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

V36 inherits operator quality, visual/accessibility/performance posture, projection-quality smoke checks, and generated quality report expectations.

### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| artifactPath | owning gate | disclosure posture | source basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v36-spec-family-report.json` | Gate 1 | source-safe | spec-family checker |
| `.bitcode/v36-canonical-input-report.json` | Gate 1 | source-safe | canonical-input checker |
| `.bitcode/v36-exchange-activity-book.json` | Gate 2 | source-safe | Exchange activity contracts |
| `.bitcode/v36-exchange-intent-order-contracts.json` | Gate 3 | source-safe | Exchange intent/order contracts |
| `.bitcode/v36-exchange-rights-transfer-review.json` | Gate 4 | source-safe | BTD rights-transfer preview |
| `.bitcode/v36-pricing-liquidity-fee-quote.json` | Gate 5 | source-safe | deterministic pricing |
| `.bitcode/v36-exchange-settlement-reconciliation.json` | Gate 6 | source-safe | ledger/database reconciliation |
| `.bitcode/v36-exchange-dispute-repair-revenue-route.json` | Gate 7 | source-safe | repair and revenue routes |
| `.bitcode/v36-exchange-ux-proof.json` | Gate 8 | source-safe | UI/API/docs integration |
| `.bitcode/v36-exchange-rehearsal.json` | Gate 9 | source-safe | local/staging rehearsal |
| `.bitcode/v36-promotion-readiness-report.json` | Gate 10 | source-safe | promotion readiness |

### V36 specifying generated artifacts

Gate 1 requires `.bitcode/v36-spec-family-report.json` and `.bitcode/v36-canonical-input-report.json` readiness.
Later gates add Exchange generated artifacts only when their package-owned builders and tests exist.

### Shared generated-artifact fields

Every V36 generated artifact includes version, artifact id, generated at, source evidence, proof roots, disclosure posture, forbidden payload classes, validation commands, and deterministic row roots where rows exist.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Exchange artifacts add activity ids, intent ids, order ids, range ids, quote roots, rights-transfer roots, settlement roots, dispute ids, repair commands, revenue routes, dashboard/runbook ids, and rehearsal evidence roots.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

V36 artifacts are public, internal, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, or operator-only.
No source-safe public artifact may carry secrets, wallet private material, raw protected prompts, raw protected model responses with source, buyer private repository data, or unpaid AssetPack source.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

`BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md` must render aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when generated evidence is stale or source-unsafe.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

V36 generated canon must be regenerated through package scripts and workflow checks.
The system fails closed when generated artifacts are missing, stale, source-unsafe, or inconsistent with `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`, the V36 family, or the proof-source commit.

## V36 validation canon

V36 validation consists of:

- `pnpm run check:v36-gate1`;
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V36 --mode draft --current-target V35`;
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V35`;
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V35 --draft-target V36`;
- package typechecks and tests touched by each gate;
- Exchange-specific tests added by Gates 2 through 10;
- workflow checks for gate PRs and promotion PRs;
- source-safe diff hygiene.

## V36 promotion canon

V36 promotion may occur only after all ten gates close and the version promotion workflow validates:

- all V36 gate checks;
- generated V36 Exchange artifacts;
- source-safe public documentation and telemetry;
- local/staging-testnet rehearsal evidence;
- generated `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md`;
- promotion dry-run;
- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer rewrite from `V35` to `V36`.

Promotion rewrites runtime posture from `V35` active / `V36` draft to `V36` active / `V37` draft only after validations pass.

## V36 appendices and canonical supporting material

### Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

V36 canonical type surfaces are `ExchangeActivityBook`, `ExchangeIntent`, `ExchangeOrder`, `ExchangeRightsTransferPreview`, `ExchangePricingQuote`, `ExchangeSettlementReceipt`, `ExchangeDisputeRepairCase`, and `ExchangeRevenueRoute`.
Public surfaces include `/exchange`, Terminal handoff panels, source-safe API payloads, public docs, telemetry dashboards, and operator runbooks.

### Appendix C. Generated artifact contract catalog

The V36 generated artifact contract catalog is defined in the generated canon section and includes `.bitcode/v36-spec-family-report.json`, `.bitcode/v36-canonical-input-report.json`, and all Exchange gate artifacts.

### Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

| gate | command | required posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gate 1 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate1` | V35 active / V36 draft |
| Gate 2 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate2` | Exchange activity book implemented |
| Gate 3 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate3` | intent/order contracts implemented |
| Gate 4 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate4` | rights-transfer review implemented |
| Gate 5 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate5` | pricing quote implemented |
| Gate 6 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate6` | settlement reconciliation implemented |

| Gate 8 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate8` | UX integration implemented |
| Gate 9 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate9` | rehearsal implemented |
| Gate 10 | `pnpm run check:v36-gate10` | promotion readiness implemented |

### Appendix E. Current canonical source map

V36 source map roots include `packages/protocol`, `packages/btd`, `packages/api`, `packages/pipelines/asset-pack`, `uapi/app/exchange`, `uapi/app/terminal`, `uapi/app/api`, public docs, workflows, scripts, and generated `.bitcode/` artifacts.
`_legacy/` is historical only.

### Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

V36 subsystem totality covers repo supply and depositing, reading and measured demand, prompt/inference/evaluator ownership, deposit-to-read fit, recall and ranking, verification decisions, selection and materialization, branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence, identity, authority, signing, and policy, sensitive data and confidentiality flows, projection, disclosure, and redaction, proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay, settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting, telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics, host/runtime capability truth, operator experience and pedagogy, validation and test stack, generated artifacts and canonical promotion.

### Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

V36 file family: `BITCODE_SPEC_V36.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and generated `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md` after promotion.
Promotion requires a version PR into `main`, promotion workflow validation, generated proof output, and `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer update.

### Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces include Exchange market dashboard, activity detail, order history, settlement review, dispute repair, revenue route review, Terminal handoff, telemetry dashboards, alert runbooks, local/staging rehearsal, and public docs.
Quality gates require accessible master-detail navigation, source-safe collapsed/expanded detail, deterministic state labels, repair instructions, and proof-root visibility.

### Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

Required cross-product scenarios remain active for auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, and auth-many-asset-normalization.
V36 Exchange scenarios must preserve Targeted deposit and Normalization deposit readings, patch/context/public asset types, buyer/reviewer/internal audiences, and Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, Valuable posture.

### Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

V36 preserves existing fail-closed causes: invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, stale promoted status truth, stale owner, cancelled order, underpayment, overpayment, projection drift, source leakage, missing rights transfer, and missing proof root.

### Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing material includes `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V36_PROVEN.md`.
Exchange may reference those roots but must not disclose protected source before settlement.

## V36 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

- V36 owns deeper Exchange.
- V37 owns website Conversations.
- V36 does not authorize value-bearing production-mainnet launch.
- V36 does not redefine BTD supply, BTC fee separation, AssetPack range identity, owner-read/licensed-read law, measureminting, ancestry, or Reading pipeline product law.
- V36 may reopen Exchange gate scope only through a documented parity row, accepted boundary, and checker update.

## V36 completion condition

V36 is complete only when all ten Exchange gates have package-owned contracts, source-safe generated artifacts, tests, documentation, workflow checks, parity closure, local/staging rehearsal evidence, and promotion readiness sufficient to rewrite `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` from `V35` to `V36` through the version promotion workflow.
