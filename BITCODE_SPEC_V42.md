## Version executive summary

V42 exists because V39 made commercial Reading real, V40 made the application testable, and V41 made prompts and PromptParts reliable enough to drive a product experience.
The version now turns that depth into the shortest believable enterprise MVP paths:

- deposit any admissible source material into the Depository with clear proof that it can later earn BTC compensation when used in a synthesized AssetPack;
- request a Read, review or resynthesize Bitcode's synthesized Need, request Finding Fits, inspect source-safe AssetPack measurements and preview metadata, settle the quoted BTD/BTC purchase, and receive the full source-bearing AssetPack as repository delivery after settlement;
- demonstrate Bitcode as an AI-reading dominant system where proprietary or otherwise non-public deposited material measurably improves an AI system beyond a public-data-only baseline.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode remains the protocol and commercial system for depositing technical knowledge, reading needs against the Depository, finding many fitting deposits, synthesizing source-safe AssetPack previews, settling BTC fees, transferring BTD rights, and delivering full source-bearing AssetPacks only after settlement.
V42 changes the product experience and demonstration proof around that law.
It must not weaken BTC settlement, BTD ownership, source-to-shares compensation, disclosure boundaries, prompt-program source-safety, or ledger/database/storage synchronization.

## V42 source-of-truth hierarchy

`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to `V41` while V42 is draft.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V41.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V41_PROVEN.md` are active canon.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V42.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PARITY_MATRIX.md` define the draft target only on `version/v42` and `v42/gate-*` branches.
Implementation remains unversioned in source paths; routes, packages, tests, prompts, components, and scripts move in place as the single current Bitcode system.

## V42 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

Reliable MVP experience work must be reconstructable from code, specification, generated artifacts, tests, telemetry, and operator documentation.
Each accepted gate must state the user path, protocol objects, route/API ownership, pipeline ownership, source-safe disclosure tier, storage projection, ledger boundary, telemetry rows, proof artifacts, and validating commands needed to rebuild the experience without conversation history.
No gate may close with only UI copy, speculative product language, or unverified route behavior.

## V42 totality and precision enforcement rule

V42 must make the product shortest paths complete without hiding complexity.
Default interfaces should be low-detail and guided, while expandable detail must preserve the rich proof, telemetry, ledger, pipeline, and storage readback required by Bitcode.
No Read can advance to Finding Fits without a reviewed synthesized Need.
No source-bearing AssetPack content can cross into reader visibility before BTC settlement, BTD rights transfer, and storage/delivery reconciliation.
No generated report may serialize secrets, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, protected source, raw provider responses, protected prompt payloads, or unpaid AssetPack source.

## V42 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- Make Depositing the shortest path from source material to Depository admission proof and later compensation visibility.
- Make Reading the shortest path from Read Request to reviewed Need, Finding Fits, source-safe AssetPack preview, BTD/BTC settlement, rights transfer, and repository delivery.
- Keep advanced proof and telemetry available through expandable detail instead of forcing enterprise users through raw protocol machinery.
- Preserve `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` as the product-owned Reading pipeline names and runtime boundaries.
- Produce a demonstration where an AssetPack improves an AI system beyond a public-data-only baseline using deposited technical intelligence.
- Keep local and staging-testnet rehearsal realistic while value-bearing mainnet operations remain explicitly gated.

Non-goals:

- V42 does not introduce agentic enterprise deposit AssetPack option synthesis; that is V43+.
- V42 does not split `/terminal` into `/read` and `/deposit`, and does not rename `/exchange` to `/packs`; those route changes are V43+ unless explicitly reopened.
- V42 does not change BTD supply law, BTC fee conservation, source-to-shares accounting, or post-settlement delivery rights.
- V42 does not expose protected source, protected prompts, raw provider responses, or unpaid AssetPack source for demonstration convenience.

Design principles: shortest credible path, source-safe preview, proof-on-expand, purchase-before-source, depositor compensation visibility, AI-reading demonstration value, and production-hardening through tests.

## V42 system architecture and layer boundaries

V42 acts through existing layers:

- website application routes and product state for Depositing, Reading, settlement, and delivery;
- packages for protocol, BTD, pipeline hosts, pipeline asset packs, prompts, tools, telemetry, and storage;
- `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` pipelines with PTRR agents, FailsafeGenerationSequence, ThricifiedGeneration, tool registries, and typed parser outputs;
- Depository indexing, search documents, embeddings, candidate fit ranking, selected-fit provenance, AssetPack synthesis, quote calculation, settlement observation, BTD rights transfer, and repository delivery;
- demonstration code inside `protocol-demonstration/` only, with no commercial imports from demonstration and no demonstration imports from commercial product code.

## V42 canonical domain model

V42 product-experience domain objects are Depositing session, source admission proof, Depository record, compensation route preview, Read Request, synthesized Need, Need review decision, Need resynthesis request, accepted Need admission, Finding Fits request, candidate fit deposit, selected fit set, AssetPack measurement preview, withheld source bundle, BTD/BTC quote, settlement instruction, settlement observation, BTD rights transfer receipt, repository delivery receipt, AI-reading baseline, AI-reading improved result, telemetry stream row, proof-root summary, and repair posture.
These objects bind to existing Bitcode objects: deposits, BTD ranges, AssetPacks, BTC fee receipts, source-to-shares rows, ledger journals, database projections, object-storage locks, VCS pull requests, prompt-program receipts, pipeline executions, and source-safe generated artifacts.

## V42 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V42 operator chain is: admit source, prove Depository availability, expose compensation posture, accept a Read Request, synthesize a Need, review or resynthesize the Need, request Finding Fits, search many Depository candidates, rank and select fitting deposits, synthesize a source-safe AssetPack preview, quote BTD/BTC purchase terms, settle BTC, transfer BTD rights, unlock source-bearing delivery, create repository pull request, journal ledger/database/storage synchronization, and expose source-safe telemetry and proof readback.

## V42 Gate 1 MVP Experience Roadmap And Spec Opening

Gate 1 opens the V42 spec family, branch posture, workflow posture, checker, roadmap, docs, and reliable MVP experience vocabulary.
It does not implement route, pipeline, settlement, or demonstration behavior beyond documentation and validation posture.
It closes when active V41 / draft V42 truth is visible in the root docs, protocol docs, workflow checks, package scripts, and roadmap, and when V42 has a precise gate plan.

## V42 Gate 2 Depositing Shortest Path And Compensation Visibility

Gate 2 makes the shortest deposit path explicit and testable.
The accepted user path is: provide source material, select repository/source anchor, admit deposit to the Depository, receive source-safe admission proof, and see how later BTC compensation will be attributed if the deposit participates in a synthesized AssetPack.
The implemented path covers route/API contracts, source validation, storage projection, Depository search-document creation, BTD/source-to-shares compensation readback, telemetry, and local/staging rehearsal posture.

Gate 2 introduces source-safe compensation visibility as a first-class Depository admission readback.
`DepositorySupplyRecord.compensationPreview` and deposit route `depositoryEvidence.compensationPreview` expose only source-safe metadata: compensation state, depositor wallet id, BTC price asset, source-to-shares largest-remainder allocation method, compensation route root, source-to-shares preview root, ledger readback keys, database projection tables, and repair blockers.
The compensation route preview is not a BTD mint and not a rights transfer.
It states that source-to-shares proof, BTC allocation, BTD rights transfer, and source-bearing AssetPack delivery occur only after an accepted Need-Fit creates a paid AssetPack and settlement finality is observed.

Gate 2 proof artifact: `.bitcode/v42-depositing-shortest-path.json`.
The artifact must prove eight source-safe rows: source-to-admission path, deposit route readiness contract, Depository record compensation preview, source-safe search/vector projection, storage readback projection, source-to-shares compensation ledger readback, Terminal compensation visibility readback, and local/staging deposit readback posture.
Validating command: `pnpm run check:v42-gate2`.

## V42 Gate 3 Reading Shortest Path State Machine

Gate 3 must make the five Reading steps a coherent product state machine: request read, review synthesized Need, request Finding Fits, review source-safe AssetPack preview, and buy/settle/deliver AssetPack.
It must simplify default Terminal experience while preserving expandable proof, execution, telemetry, ledger, and storage detail.
It must prove route persistence, transaction ids, stage transitions, restart/retry behavior, source-safe UI rendering, and failure states.

Gate 3 implements that state machine through `TerminalEnterpriseReadingUxState` and `TerminalEnterpriseReadingRouteState`.
The route-owned state carries a recoverable transaction id, `readingStage` stage intent, retry and restart posture, source-safe failure kind, and repair action metadata.
Route state may hydrate the active stage on refresh or Conversation handoff, but it does not waive blockers: Finding Fits still requires accepted Need, source-safe AssetPack preview still gates settlement, and delivery still requires settlement readback.

Gate 3 proof artifact: `.bitcode/v42-reading-shortest-path-state-machine.json`.
This is the canonical V42 reading shortest path state machine artifact for the MVP Reading route contract.
The artifact must prove nine source-safe rows: five-step Reading path, transaction/stage route persistence, accepted-Need transition, restart/retry/failure repair, low-detail proof-on-expand UI, rich Reading pipeline telemetry, activity/workbench readback, route/component/stream tests, and SPEC/DELTA/NOTES/PARITY/README/workflow closure.
Validating command: `pnpm run check:v42-gate3`.

## V42 Gate 4 ReadNeed Review And Resynthesis Product Closure

Gate 4 must make `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` product-ready in the MVP flow.
The pipeline must synthesize exactly the user's Need from the Read Request, store source-safe Need data, allow user feedback and resynthesis, preserve lineage, and admit Finding Fits only after the Need is accepted.
It must cover PTRR agents, FailsafeGenerationSequence, ThricifiedGeneration, prompts, parser return types, telemetry rows, database projection, tests, and UI readback.
Gate 4 is implemented by `.bitcode/v42-readneed-review-resynthesis-product-closure.json`.
The artifact binds `ReadNeedReviewResynthesisRuntime`, all four review actions, source-safe storage projection, rejection posture, accepted-Need admission into `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis`, Terminal runtime/storage/telemetry readback, and the package/API/protocol tests that prove the path.

## V42 Gate 5 ReadFitsFinding AssetPack Preview And Quote Closure

Gate 5 must make `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` product-ready in the MVP flow.
The pipeline must search the Depository for many candidates above threshold, rank candidates, select fits, synthesize source-safe AssetPack measurements and preview metadata, keep source-bearing content withheld, calculate deterministic BTD/BTC quote posture, and expose a reviewable preview.
It must cover vector search and provider search tooling, selected-fit provenance, prompt/tool return types, telemetry, quote formula readback, source-safe UI, and failure/repair states.
Gate 5 is implemented by `.bitcode/v42-readfitsfinding-preview-quote.json`.
The artifact binds the accepted-Need gate, many-channel Depository search, candidate ranking, selected-fit provenance, `AssetPackPreviewBoundary`, deterministic share-to-fee quote receipt, disclosure review, settlement instructions, delivery lock, harness route summary, Terminal preview/quote/provenance readback, and the package/API/protocol tests that prove no protected source or unpaid AssetPack source crosses the pre-settlement boundary.

## V42 Gate 6 Settlement Rights Transfer And Repository Delivery Closure

Gate 6 must make purchase and delivery reliable.
The accepted user path is: review the AssetPack preview, choose to buy, receive settlement instructions, observe BTC/testnet settlement in the admitted lane, transfer BTD rights to the Reader, unlock source-bearing AssetPack delivery, and create the repository pull request.
It must prove ledger/database/object-storage synchronization, delivery locks, no pre-settlement source leakage, compensation accounting, repair actions, and operator readback.
Gate 6 is implemented by `.bitcode/v42-settlement-rights-delivery.json`.
The artifact binds `AssetPackSettlementRightsDeliveryBoundary`, `AssetPackSettlementPaymentObservation`, confirmed BTC/testnet finality, `BtdRightsTransferReceipt`, `BtdReadReceipt`, `SourceToSharesProof`, `AssetPackDeliveryUnlockReceipt`, ledger/database/object-storage reconciliation, live harness materialization, source-safe route summaries, and Terminal settlement rights readback.
Source-bearing AssetPack delivery remains withheld until payment, finality, BTD rights transfer, source-to-shares compensation conservation, reconciliation readback, and pull-request delivery all agree.

## V42 Gate 7 AI-Reading Dominant Demonstration MVP

Gate 7 must update the standalone demonstration so it proves Bitcode's AI-reading value.
The demonstration should show deposited non-public technical intelligence becoming an AssetPack that measurably improves an AI system's training, prompt/context, or evaluation performance beyond a public-data-only baseline.
It must remain minimal, self-contained inside `protocol-demonstration/`, and independent from commercial product code.
Gate 7 is implemented by `.bitcode/v42-ai-reading-demonstration.json`.
The artifact binds the local public-data-only baseline, reviewed ReadNeed synthesis, local Depository Finding Fits, selected AssetPack preview, AssetPack-enhanced AI-reading answer, basis-point benchmark uplift, settlement-gated source-safety boundary, self-contained demonstration import boundary, demonstration tests, protocol tests, docs, package scripts, and workflow wiring.
The accepted proof is an AI-reading AssetPack improvement: public-only assistance scores below the AssetPack-enhanced result, selected deposit provenance is explicit, protected source remains withheld before settlement, and the demonstration can run locally without product runtime imports.

## V42 Gate 8 Local And Staging-Testnet Full MVP Rehearsal

Gate 8 must rehearse the full MVP path locally and in staging-testnet without value-bearing mainnet behavior.
It must exercise deposit, Read Request, Need synthesis/review/resynthesis, Finding Fits, AssetPack preview, quote, settlement simulation or testnet observation, BTD rights projection, repository delivery, telemetry, proof artifacts, and repair readback.

## V42 Gate 9 V42 Promotion Readiness

Gate 9 closes V42 promotion readiness.
It must bind every V42 artifact, test, workflow, generated proof support, promotion command, active V42 / draft V43 runtime preparation, source-safe generated appendix output, and value-bearing mainnet blocking where relevant.
It closes only when V42 can be promoted as the reliable MVP experience canon.

## V42 generated canon

### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

V42 inherits byte-stable generated proof expectations, deterministic replay posture, and promotion artifact discipline from V19.

### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

V42 inherits operator-quality expectations for browser proof, accessibility, visual checks, performance posture, and operator acceptance from V20.

### V42 specifying generated artifacts

V42 specifying artifacts must be generated from code or deterministic scripts, committed only when source-safe, and checked by gate-quality and canon-quality workflows.

### Shared generated-artifact fields

Shared fields are artifact id, schema id, version, current target, source roots, validation commands, proof roots, generated at policy, disclosure posture, and verdict.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Artifact-specific fields include deposit ids, Reading stage ids, prompt/parser ids, selected fit roots, quote roots, settlement roots, delivery roots, AI baseline ids, benchmark ids, and rehearsal ids.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

Allowed public payloads are ids, hashes, counts, statuses, source-safe summaries, measurement scores, proof roots, and redaction verdicts.
Forbidden payloads are secrets, wallet private material, private settlement payloads, protected source, raw provider responses, protected prompt payloads, and unpaid AssetPack source.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The generated `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PROVEN.md` must include aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when any required proof is missing.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Promotion must fail closed when generated artifacts are missing, stale, non-deterministic, source-unsafe, disconnected from workflow checks, or inconsistent with `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`.

## V42 validation canon

Validation must include:

- `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V42 --mode draft --current-target V41`;
- `node scripts/check-v42-gate1-mvp-experience-roadmap-opening.mjs`;
- later V42 gate checks as each gate opens;
- route/API/unit/integration/browser checks appropriate to each product behavior gate;
- local and staging-testnet rehearsal checks before promotion.

## V42 promotion canon

V42 promotion requires all V42 gates closed, all generated artifacts deterministic and source-safe, gate-quality and canon-quality workflows green, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PROVEN.md` generated, active V42 / draft V43 runtime posture prepared, and value-bearing mainnet operations explicitly blocked unless later canon admits them.

## V42 appendices and canonical supporting material

Supporting material includes `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, package READMEs, root README, `SPECIFICATIONS_ROADMAP.md`, workflow files, generated `.bitcode/` artifacts, and protocol-demonstration documents.

## V42 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

Accepted boundaries:

- V42 Gate 1 is specification and validation posture only.
- V42 may refine `/terminal` but does not split `/read` and `/deposit`.
- V42 may improve exchange-to-pack language where user-facing clarity requires it, but full `/exchange` to `/packs` route rename is deferred to V43+.
- V42 may update demonstration only inside `protocol-demonstration/`.

Reopen conditions:

- a route, pipeline, or generated artifact exposes protected source or unpaid AssetPack source;
- Need review is bypassed before Finding Fits;
- settlement or BTD rights transfer is claimed without ledger/database/storage reconciliation;
- AI-reading demonstration cannot prove improvement beyond public-data-only baseline;
- workflow posture allows stale V42 artifacts to pass.

## V42 completion condition

V42 closes when the reliable MVP product experience is fully specified, implemented, tested, source-safe, rehearsed locally and in staging-testnet, documented, generated, workflow-checked, and promotion-ready across Depositing, Reading, Finding Fits, AssetPack preview, BTD/BTC settlement, repository delivery, depositor compensation visibility, and the AI-reading dominant demonstration.

## Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Canonical types include Depositing session, source admission proof, Depository record, compensation route preview, Read Request, synthesized Need, Need review decision, accepted Need, Finding Fits request, candidate fit deposit, selected fit set, AssetPack preview, BTD/BTC quote, settlement receipt, BTD rights transfer, repository delivery receipt, AI-reading baseline, AI-reading improved result, telemetry row, proof root, and repair posture.

## Appendix B. Proof family closure catalog

V42 proof families close through the exact proof-family inventory matrix and per-family sections above.

## Appendix C. Generated artifact contract catalog

V42 generated artifacts are source-safe, deterministic, workflow-bound, and promotion-blocking when stale.

## Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

V42 gate validation starts with `check:v42-gate1` and expands gate by gate into package tests, route tests, browser tests, rehearsal scripts, and promotion readiness checks.

## Appendix E. Current canonical source map

Current source roots are `packages/protocol`, `packages/btd`, `packages/pipelines/asset-pack`, `packages/pipeline-hosts`, `packages/prompts`, `packages/tools-generics`, `packages/observability`, `packages/github`, `uapi`, `.github/workflows`, `scripts`, and `protocol-demonstration`.

## Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

V42 must cover repo supply and depositing, reading and measured demand, prompt/inference/evaluator ownership, deposit-to-read fit, recall and ranking, verification decisions, selection and materialization, branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence, identity, authority, signing, and policy, sensitive data and confidentiality flows, projection, disclosure, and redaction, proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay, settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting, telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics, host/runtime capability truth, operator experience and pedagogy, validation and test stack, and generated artifacts and canonical promotion.

## Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

V42 file-family contracts are `BITCODE_SPEC_V42.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and eventual `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PROVEN.md`.

## Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces include `/terminal`, depositing controls, Reading controls, execution stream rows, settlement panels, delivery receipts, Auxillaries wallet/organization surfaces, demonstration pages, and generated proof reports.

## Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

V42 scenario coverage must include auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch, context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, and Valuable workflows.

## Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

V42 fails closed on invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, stale promoted status truth, source leakage, missing Need review, missing settlement finality, and repository delivery authorization failure.

## Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing contracts include `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V42_PROVEN.md`.
These contracts keep full AssetPack source withheld until settlement, BTD rights transfer, and delivery unlock.
