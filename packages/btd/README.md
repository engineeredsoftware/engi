# BTD Core

Canonical `$BTD` registry, read-right, BTC-fee, and measureminting utilities
for Bitcode.

This package owns:
- the 21,000,000-cell fixed supply ceiling
- fixed-supply measureminting decay and zero-cell tail receipts
- proof-addressable semantic volume measurement
- contiguous AssetPack range allocation and mint receipts
- contributor allocation, access evaluation, ancestry review, and revenue routing
- wallet-signed BTC fee receipts, ledger anchors, Exchange rights transfers,
  Terminal journals, reconciliation, telemetry, and upgrade receipts
- typed AssetPack mint/read/rights-transfer receipts that bind BTD ranges,
  Reader and Depositor identities, source-safe preview roots, paid unlock,
  delivery admission, and ledger projection roots without leaking protected
  source before settlement
- source-to-shares proof cleanup: contribution measurement, deterministic
  largest-remainder share weights, BTD range slices, exact BTC fee allocation,
  settlement conservation, zero-cell/refit tail posture, ancestry evidence, and
  no-overpayment/no-underpayment theorem verdicts
- bridge-readiness research boundaries for Taproot, BitVM, BSC/opBNB,
  Binance Web3 Wallet, and future distribution paths; every bridge posture is
  research-only and cannot become current `$BTD` chain-of-record truth without
  explicit future proof and policy admission
- Protocol telemetry proof hooks through `BtdProtocolTelemetryEnvelope`,
  source-safe `BtdProtocolTelemetryRecord` rows, and
  `BtdProtocolProofHook` bindings for receipts, BTC fee states, ledger
  projections, source-to-shares proofs, and bridge-readiness posture
- Interface integration regression proof through
  `BtdInterfaceIntegrationRegressionProof`, the client-safe
  `@bitcode/btd/interface-integration-contract` subpath, and source-safe
  records proving Terminal, API, MCP, ChatGPT App, Auxillaries hooks, and
  Exchange hooks consume package-owned Protocol/BTD objects without local
  policy copies
- ledger/database/object-storage projection reconciliation, including
  deterministic repair classes, source-safe object artifact roots,
  secret-free Supabase staging-testnet readback receipts, quarantine/retry
  actions, and settlement-unlock blocking posture
- BTC fee operation posture, including quote lifecycle, signer recovery,
  no-server-custody PSBT handoff, Taproot/script posture, broadcast/finality
  observation, replacement/reorg repair, and testnet/mainnet network policy
- Auxillaries Wallet/BTD support projection through
  `BtdWalletBtdSupportProjection`, which derives no-custody wallet capability,
  signer posture, network readiness, source-safe BTD range/read-right counts,
  account treasury posture, settlement blockers, and roots without exposing
  protected source or wallet private material
- Terminal operational health reads that compose deployment lanes, telemetry,
  upgrade posture, provider readiness, settlement-network posture, synthetic
  testnet minting, journal rows, ledger anchors, and reconciliation state
- `api-boundaries.ts`, the framework-agnostic BTD API boundary for shared route
  objects, BigInt parsers, validators, settlement builders, registry snapshot
  builders, read-access decision builders, and JSON-safe serialization

`$BTD` is not a fungible fee token. BTC pays fees. `$BTD` represents a
non-fungible AssetPack share/read-right and the measured Bitcode amount in
content. V27 issuance follows measured Read-Fit-Prove-Settle admission through
the measureminting curve; valid tail events may emit zero-cell receipts rather
than failing the measurement.

The current database layer still exposes `user_credits` as a storage carrier
for aggregate holding reads until the persistence schema is re-cut. This
package must not mutate it as a spendable balance bucket.

```ts
import {
  buildGenerationBitcodeAccounting,
  BTD_MAX_MINTABLE_SUPPLY,
  applyBtdMeasureMint,
  buildBtdMintDraft,
  buildBtdReadReceiptBoundarySettlement,
  buildBtdRightsTransferReceipt,
  buildBtdRegistrySnapshot,
  buildSupabaseStagingTestnetProjectionReadback,
  buildSourceToSharesProof,
  buildBridgeReadinessResearchPosture,
  buildBtdProtocolTelemetryEnvelope,
  buildBtdInterfaceIntegrationRegressionProof,
  buildBtdWalletBtdSupportProjection,
  reconcileLedgerDatabaseProjection,
  sourceToSharesProofToSettlementConservationCheck,
  toBtdJsonSafe,
  calculateLlmBtcFeeEstimate,
  buildLicensedReadRevenueRoute,
  getBtdBalance,
  measureProofAddressableSemanticVolume,
  readBtdHoldings,
} from '@bitcode/btd';
```

Accepted imports point into `@bitcode/btd` or the documented
`@bitcode/btd/terminal-operational-health` subpath. API routes, Terminal, MCP,
ChatGPT App, Auxillaries, and Exchange must not copy BTD admission, receipt,
settlement, parser, validator, or serializer logic locally when this package
exports the boundary object.

Auxillaries is an accepted BTD consumer, not a BTD policy owner. Wallet and BTD
support panes can surface range, read-right, treasury, signer, settlement, and
no-custody posture from this package through source-safe summaries, but they
must not rederive `$BTD` mint, read-access, rights-transfer, BTC fee, bridge,
or source-disclosure law locally.
The Auxillaries support projection is account-treasury support, not Exchange
market state, and always keeps protected source invisible before paid unlock.

Terminal should consume the operational-health subpath when it needs the
client-safe read model without importing storage-backed package entry points:

```ts
import { buildTerminalOperationalHealthRead } from '@bitcode/btd/terminal-operational-health';
```

Terminal and other browser-facing interfaces should consume
`@bitcode/btd/interface-integration-contract` when they only need source-safe
surface and object-family contracts. Server-side boundaries can use
`buildBtdInterfaceIntegrationRegressionProof` or
`buildBtdInterfaceIntegrationRegressionSettlement` to prove those records
without reimplementing BTD receipt, fee, ledger, telemetry, access, authority,
or journal policy in route-local code.
