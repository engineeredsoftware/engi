/**
 * SEQUENTIAL EXECUTOR - Pipe through steps in order

 * Each executor receives the output of the previous one.
 * Creates execution tree: seq-0 → seq-1 → seq-2 → ...
 *
 * Foundation of:
 * - PTRR flow: sequential(plan, try, refine, retry)
 * - SDIVF pipeline: sequential(setup, divLoop, finish)
 * - PTRR substeps (conceptual): Steps compose parent Failsafes, each running Generation children.
 *   Do not sequence Reason/Judge/Structured across failsafes; parents orchestrate children.
