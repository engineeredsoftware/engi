# @bitcode/protocol

Formal Bitcode protocol package for commercial source.

V29 Gate 8 made this package the package-native boundary for canonical helpers
that were originally ported from the standalone `protocol-demonstration`
witness. Commercial scripts, API/runtime code, and workflow checks must import
canon posture, spec-family checks, canonical-input checks, canon-drift checks,
and proven-generation helpers from `@bitcode/protocol` or
`packages/protocol/src/index.js`.

They must not import `protocol-demonstration/src/*`. The demonstration remains
a standalone minimal witness and may still be executed or cited by proof
inventories, but it is not a commercial runtime implementation dependency.

Current exported commercial helpers include:

- active/draft canon posture (`V45` active, `V46` draft after V45 promotion);

V40 Gate 1 treated this package as promotion-critical runtime posture and opened
the exhaustive testing specification family for active V39 / draft V40 work.
`packages/protocol/src/canon-posture.js` and `packages/protocol/data/state.json`
must remain aligned to `V40` active, `V41` draft after V40 promotion.
V40 Gate 1 is wired through `check:v40-gate1` and documents the exact browser
E2E, visual/screenshot, API integration, pipeline integration, Conversation and
Terminal integration, unit coverage, ledger/database/storage synchronization,
local/staging rehearsal, prompt benchmark smoke, and V41 prompt-program
readiness scope that later V40 gates must implement.
After V40 promotion this package is in the `V40` active, `V41` draft posture.
V41 Gate 1 is wired through `check:v41-gate1` and opens the prompt-program
specification family: every raw PromptPart, composed Prompt, registry binding,
interpolation contract, inference callsite, benchmark fixture, parsed return
type, and source-safe telemetry projection must become enumerable before later
V41 gates rewrite Reading, Conversation, tool-definition, or interface prompts.

V36 Gate 8 adds source-safe Exchange UX proof through `buildExchangeUxProof`
and `.bitcode/v36-exchange-ux-proof.json`.
`ExchangeUxProof` covers market-wide master-detail, filters, order history, rights-transfer review, pricing quote, settlement state, and repair state.
Terminal can hand off to Exchange without losing transaction context.
collapsed UI gives readable status and expanded UI exposes source-safe detail.
Exchange telemetry dashboards remain source-safe and proof-rooted.
The source-safe verdict is `source-safe-exchange-ux-proof-metadata`.

V36 Gate 9 adds source-safe Exchange rehearsal through
`buildExchangeRehearsal` and `.bitcode/v36-exchange-rehearsal.json`.
`ExchangeRehearsal` proves that local and staging-testnet rehearsals exercise list, bid, ask, cancel, accept, settle, repair, and history flows.
It proves that rehearsal logs/screenshots are source-safe.
It also proves that ledger/database synchronization and value-bearing mainnet blocking are visible.
The source-safe verdict is `source-safe-exchange-rehearsal-metadata`.

Historical promotion posture remains reproducible. V34 Gate 10 accepted the
`V34` active, `V35` draft posture for deployment-depth promotion and remains
validated by `check:v34-gate10` and `v34-canon-promotion.yml` as promoted
history.

V35 Gate 2 adds the source-safe documentation surface catalog through
`buildDocumentationSurfaceCatalog` and
`.bitcode/v35-documentation-surface-catalog.json`.
V35 Gate 3 adds the source-safe telemetry taxonomy catalog through
`buildTelemetryTaxonomyCatalog` and

V35 Gate 9 adds the source-safe local/staging telemetry documentation rehearsal
through `buildLocalStagingTelemetryDocumentationRehearsal` and
`.bitcode/v35-local-staging-telemetry-documentation-rehearsal.json`.
V37 gates add Conversations helpers without importing
`protocol-demonstration/src/*`.

V35 Gate 10 closed the package/runtime promotion boundary and the V35 promotion
workflow rewrote the package posture to `V35` active, `V36` draft after
promotion validations and generated proof output passed. V36 promotion rewrote
this package to `V36` active, `V37` draft only after all Exchange gates closed.
V36 Gate 10 closes that Exchange promotion boundary through package-owned
`ExchangePromotionReadinessReport`, `.bitcode/v36-promotion-readiness-report.json`,
`check:v36-gate10`, and `v36-canon-promotion.yml`. The post-promotion posture is
`V36` active, `V37` draft, and the generated evidence remains source-safe.
V37 promotion will eventually rewrite this package to `V37` active, `V38` draft
only after all Conversations gates close.

The package boundary is enforced by `packages/protocol` tests, the UAPI
commercial protocol boundary test, and V37 gate checks.
