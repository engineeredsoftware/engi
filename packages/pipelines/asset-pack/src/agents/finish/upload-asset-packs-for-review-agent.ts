/**
 * Upload AssetPacks for review — Finish phase (V48 Gate 3).
 *
 * Both synthesis modes finish by uploading the synthesized AssetPack artifacts
 * to Bitcode for the USER to review: deposit → review before admitting into the
 * Depository as supply; read → review before purchase. Opening a pull request
 * is NOT part of synthesis (that moves to the future Gate-6 SettleAssetPacks
 * pipeline: confirm BTC payment, mint BTD, transfer rights).
 *
 * A simple (non-PTRR) finalization agent: it reads the synthesized artifacts
 * from the Implementation phase stores and records them as a reviewable upload.
