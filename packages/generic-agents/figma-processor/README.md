# Figma Processor Agent

Design-to-development bridge agent with Figma API integration for artboard extraction and implementation guidance generation.

## Overview

The Figma Processor Agent provides comprehensive design analysis through Figma API integration, extracting artboards, analyzing design systems, and generating developer-ready implementation specifications. It bridges the gap between design and development workflows with pixel-perfect reference extraction.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Figma API Integration
- Authentication and secure file access through Figma Access Token
- File structure navigation and page discovery
- Artboard identification and metadata extraction
- High-resolution PNG export with configurable scaling (2x default)

### 2. Design Analysis and Extraction
- Artboard dimension analysis and responsive breakpoint identification
- Component structure analysis for design system patterns
- Layout specification extraction with spacing and grid analysis
- Visual hierarchy identification for implementation guidance

### 3. Implementation Guidance Generation
- Component hierarchy recommendations based on design structure
- Technical specification generation from visual analysis
- Responsive design considerations and breakpoint documentation
- Design system pattern identification and documentation

### 4. Quality Assurance and Validation
- Image extraction success rate monitoring
- Design specification completeness assessment
- Artboard coverage analysis across design file pages
- Implementation readiness scoring with quality metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `@engi/figma-tools` - Figma API tool integration
- `@engi/agent-generics` - Base agent framework with PTRR methodology
- `zod` - Schema validation for structured outputs
- Environment variable: `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` for API authentication

### Supported Design Sources
Primary sources:
- Figma file URLs (`figma.com/file/...`)
- Specific artboard links with node-id parameters
- File key references for programmatic access

### PTRR Implementation
- **Plan**: Analyzes Figma URLs and determines extraction strategy
- **Try**: Executes file structure analysis and artboard extraction
- **Refine**: Assesses extraction quality and design coverage
- **Intensify**: Consolidates design specifications into implementation guidance

## Usage

The agent processes Figma design references through comprehensive extraction:

```typescript
// Figma URL processing
const designAnalysis = await FIGMA_PROCESSOR_AGENT.processFigma.execute({
  attachments: [{
    type: 'url',
    content: 'https://figma.com/file/ABC123/Design-System?node-id=12%3A34',
    name: 'Dashboard Design'
  }]
});
```

## Output Structure

### Artboard Analysis Result
```typescript
{
  consolidatedDesignContent: {
    artboards: Array<{
      id: string,
      name: string,
      pageName: string,
      dimensions: {
        width: number,
        height: number
      },
      imageAvailable: boolean
    }>,
    designSpecs: string[],
    implementationGuidance: string[]
  },
  keyFindings: string[],
  designSystemNotes: string,
  visualRequirements: string[]
}
```

## Processing Strategy

### File Discovery Pipeline
1. Figma URL parsing and file key extraction
2. Authentication validation and API access verification
3. File structure analysis and page enumeration
4. Artboard discovery and metadata collection
5. High-resolution image extraction (2x scale)

### Design Analysis Methodology
- Layout structure analysis for component hierarchy
- Spacing system identification and grid pattern recognition
- Typography and color system extraction from design tokens
- Responsive design pattern analysis across artboard variants

## Performance Characteristics
- Authentication requirement: Figma Access Token mandatory
- Image extraction resolution: 2x scale for high-quality references
- Processing timeout: 120 seconds per file operation
- Maximum artboards: Optimized for design files with 50+ artboards
- Quality thresholds: 85% extraction success, 80% design coverage

## Integration Points
- Requires `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable for API access
- Integrates with discovery phase context for design system documentation
- Provides structured design specifications for implementation agents
- Compatible with artifact storage for extracted design references
- Updates global context with design system patterns and constraints

## Error Handling
- Authentication failure detection with clear error messaging
- File access permission validation and troubleshooting guidance
- Network connectivity resilience with retry mechanisms
- Individual artboard extraction error isolation
- Graceful degradation when partial extraction succeeds

## Design System Integration
- Component pattern identification across artboard variants
- Design token extraction for consistent implementation
- Responsive breakpoint analysis and documentation
- Visual hierarchy mapping for development component structure
- Brand consistency validation across design file pages
