# Ready-To-Short-Circuit Agent

## Overview

Critical control flow agent that determines pipeline execution continuity through systematic analysis of accumulated context data. Executes as final validation step across all pipeline phases to assess task feasibility and prevent cost escalation on unresolvable operations.

## Core Capabilities

- **Context Analysis**: Examines accumulated pipeline execution data for blocking patterns
- **Issue Classification**: Identifies and categorizes recoverable vs. unresolvable issues
- **Decision Logic**: Implements systematic evaluation framework for continuation decisions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects common failure patterns through configurable rule engine
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculates confidence scores for decision validation

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Built on GenericAgent base with SIMPLE_CONTEXT_STITCH execution pattern
- Implements 4-step PTRR methodology (Plan → Try → Refine → Intensify)
- Utilizes structured schema validation for consistent output format
- Includes circuit breaker pattern for error containment

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Plan**: Pattern analysis of accumulated context with blocking issue detection
2. **Try**: Resolvability assessment with iteration potential evaluation
3. **Refine**: Decision logic validation with confidence scoring
4. **Intensify**: Final determination with justification and artifact generation

### Decision Matrix
```
Blocking Issues + Unresolvable → SHORT_CIRCUIT
Blocking Issues + Resolvable → CONTINUE
No Blocking Issues → CONTINUE
Low Confidence → CONTINUE (conservative default)
```

## Output Structure

### Final Decision Schema
```typescript
{
  finalDecision: 'SHORT_CIRCUIT' | 'CONTINUE',
  justification: string,
  riskMitigation: string,
  userExplanation: string,
  success: boolean
}
```

### Artifacts Generated
- `short-circuit-decision.json`: Complete analysis chain with decision rationale
- `final-decision.txt`: Plain text decision for downstream consumption

## Performance Characteristics

- **Execution Time**: 15-75 seconds depending on context size
- **Memory Usage**: Scales linearly with accumulated context size
- **Accuracy Target**: 95% blocking issue detection
- **Conservative Bias**: Defaults to CONTINUE on uncertain conditions
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback decisions

### Quality Metrics
- Accuracy: 0.95 target for blocking issue identification
- Consistency: 0.90 target for reproducible decisions
- Reliability: 0.95 target for system stability
