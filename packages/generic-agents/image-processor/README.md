# Image Processor Agent

## Overview

The Image Processor Agent provides comprehensive image analysis capabilities through multi-modal processing combining optical character recognition (OCR), computer vision analysis, and UI specification extraction. This agent transforms visual content into structured, implementable technical specifications optimized for software development workflows.

## Core Capabilities

### Multi-Modal Image Analysis
- **Optical Character Recognition**: High-accuracy text extraction using Tesseract with multi-language support (English, French, German, Spanish)
- **Computer Vision Processing**: GPT-4 Vision API integration for semantic image understanding and element identification
- **UI Component Detection**: Automated identification of interface elements, layouts, and design patterns
- **Technical Content Recognition**: Code structure analysis, framework detection, and architecture diagram interpretation

### Image Processing Pipeline
- **Metadata Extraction**: Comprehensive image property analysis including dimensions, format, quality assessment, and color space detection
- **Image Optimization**: Automated preprocessing for OCR enhancement with sharpening, normalization, and resolution optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel processing of multiple image attachments with performance monitoring and telemetry integration

### Specification Generation
- **Implementation-Ready Output**: Structured component specifications, design patterns, and technical requirements
- **Framework Detection**: Automatic identification of React, Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks
- **Design System Analysis**: Layout structure mapping, component hierarchy extraction, and responsive design considerations

## Technical Implementation

### Processing Architecture
The agent implements a PTRR (Plan-Try-Refine-Reflect) execution pattern with the following workflow:

1. **Plan**: Image attachment discovery and processing strategy formulation
2. **Try**: Parallel execution of OCR and computer vision analysis
3. **Refine**: Quality assessment and optimization recommendations
4. **Intensify**: Consolidated analysis with implementation guidance

### Image Processing Functions
```typescript
interface ImageAnalysisResult {
  metadata: ImageMetadata;           // Technical properties and quality metrics
  ocr: OCRResult;                   // Text extraction with confidence scoring
  vision: VisionAnalysis;           // Computer vision semantic analysis
  analysis: {
    imageType: string;              // Classification: ui-mockup | code-screenshot | diagram
    extractedText: string;          // Consolidated text content
    technicalTerms: string[];       // Identified frameworks and technologies
    uiSpecifications: string[];     // Implementation-ready component specs
    designPatterns: string[];       // Recognized design patterns
  };
  relevanceScore: number;           // Task relevance assessment
  keyInsights: string[];           // Actionable development insights
}
```

### Quality Assessment Framework
- **OCR Accuracy**: Text extraction confidence scoring with multi-language detection
- **Vision Analysis Quality**: Computer vision confidence and semantic understanding metrics
- **Content Relevance**: Task-specific relevance scoring and context matching
- **Technical Utility**: Implementation value assessment based on extracted specifications

## Output Structure

### Analysis Results
Each processed image generates structured output containing:
- **Technical Metadata**: Dimensions, format, quality classification, and file properties
- **Extracted Content**: OCR text, UI elements, technical elements, and design specifications
- **Implementation Guidance**: Component specifications, framework recommendations, and design patterns
- **Quality Metrics**: Confidence scores, relevance assessment, and processing statistics

### Integration Data
Results are integrated into the global discovery phase context for cross-agent utilization:
```typescript
{
  images: {
    analyses: ImageAnalysisResult[];
    consolidatedContent: {
      extractedText: string;
      uiElements: string[];
      technicalElements: string[];
      designSpecifications: string[];
    };
    keyFindings: string[];
    visualRequirements: string[];
    quality: QualityAssessment;
  }
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Processing Efficiency
- **Parallel Analysis**: Simultaneous OCR and computer vision processing for optimal throughput
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic preprocessing reduces API payload size while maintaining analysis quality
- **Memory Management**: Temporary file cleanup and resource optimization for large image batches

### Scalability Metrics
- **Processing Time**: Typically 3-8 seconds per image depending on size and complexity
- **Quality Thresholds**: OCR confidence >70%, Vision analysis confidence >80% for production use
- **Batch Processing**: Supports multiple images with parallel execution and consolidated reporting

### Integration Points
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API**: Semantic image understanding and technical content analysis
- **Tesseract OCR Engine**: Multi-language text extraction with preprocessing optimization
- **Sharp Image Processing**: High-performance image manipulation and optimization
- **Global Context Integration**: Discovery phase data persistence for cross-agent coordination

The Image Processor Agent delivers production-ready visual content analysis with comprehensive technical specifications, enabling efficient translation of design assets into implementable software components.
