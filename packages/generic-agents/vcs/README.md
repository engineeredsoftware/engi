# VCS Agent

## Overview

Version Control System orchestration agent that provides unified API-based operations across multiple VCS providers. Supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket through standardized interfaces without direct system git command execution.

## Core Capabilities

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Unified interface for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket APIs
- **Pull Request Operations**: Creation, review, and comment management
- **Branch Management**: Branch creation and synchronization across providers
- **Issue Management**: Issue creation and comment handling
- **Repository Synchronization**: Bulk repository data sync with local caching
- **Authentication Handling**: OAuth token management with connection persistence

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Built on VCS abstraction layer with provider factory pattern
- Implements circuit breaker for fault tolerance
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for network resilience
- Connection pooling through VCSConnections manager

### Provider Integration
```typescript
Supported Operations:
- createPullRequest()
- reviewPullRequest()
- createIssue()
- createComment()
- createBranch()
- syncRepositories()
```

### Error Handling
- Circuit breaker with 5-failure threshold
- 60-second timeout with 2-minute reset
- Retry on network errors and rate limits
- Graceful degradation with error reporting

## Output Structure

### Operation Result Schema
```typescript
{
  success: boolean,
  result: any,
  error?: string
}
```

### Repository Sync Schema
```typescript
{
  count: number,
  repositories: string[]
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **API Rate Limits**: Respects provider-specific limits
- **Concurrent Operations**: Parallel processing where applicable
- **Cache Strategy**: Repository metadata cached in database
- **Connection Reuse**: Persistent OAuth connections
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts per operation type

### Reliability Features
- Automatic retry on transient failures
- Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- Connection validation before operations
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Supported Providers
- **GitHub**: Full API support including advanced features
- **GitLab**: Core operations with self-hosted instance support
- **Bitbucket**: Standard operations with team account support

### Security Model
- OAuth-based authentication only
- No direct credential storage
- Encrypted connection management
- Provider-specific permission scoping
