# Bitbucket MCP Tool

## Overview

Industrial Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for Atlassian Bitbucket operations. Provides comprehensive repository management, pull request lifecycle, issue tracking, and collaborative development workflows through standardized MCP protocol interface.

## Core Capabilities

### Repository Management
- Repository listing and metadata retrieval
- Branch and tag lifecycle management
- File content operations and directory browsing
- Commit creation and history analysis

### Pull Request Lifecycle
- Pull request creation and management
- Code review workflow automation
- Merge strategy configuration
- Approval and decline operations

### Issue Tracking System
- Issue creation and status management
- Priority and type classification
- Assignment and collaboration features
- Comment and discussion threads

### Collaboration Features
- Multi-user workspace operations
- Role-based access control
- OAuth and basic authentication support
- Cross-repository operations

## MCP Operations

| Operation Category | Operations | Purpose |
|-------------------|------------|---------|
| **Repository** | `listRepositories`, `getRepository` | Repository discovery and metadata |
| **Branch Management** | `listBranches`, `createBranch` | Branch lifecycle operations |
| **Tag Management** | `listTags`, `createTag` | Release and version tagging |
| **File Operations** | `getFileContent`, `listDirectory`, `commitFiles` | File system operations |
| **Commit Operations** | `listCommits`, `getCommit`, `getCommitDiff` | Version history and analysis |
| **Pull Requests** | `listPullRequests`, `createPullRequest`, `updatePullRequest`, `commentOnPullRequest`, `approvePullRequest`, `mergePullRequest`, `declinePullRequest` | Code review workflow |
| **Issue Tracking** | `listIssues`, `createIssue`, `updateIssue`, `commentOnIssue`, `deleteIssue` | Project management |

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Pattern
```typescript
import { bitbucketMCPTool } from '@engi/generic-tools-mcps-bitbucket';

// Repository operations
const repositories = await bitbucketMCPTool.use('listRepositories', {
  workspace: 'company-workspace',
  role: 'contributor',
  accessToken: process.env.BITBUCKET_TOKEN
});

// Pull request lifecycle
const pullRequest = await bitbucketMCPTool.use('createPullRequest', {
  workspace: 'company-workspace',
  repoSlug: 'main-application',
  title: 'Feature: User authentication system',
  sourceBranch: 'feature/auth-system',
  destinationBranch: 'main',
  description: 'Implements OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens',
  closeSourceBranch: true,
  accessToken: process.env.BITBUCKET_TOKEN
});

// Issue management
const issue = await bitbucketMCPTool.use('createIssue', {
  workspace: 'company-workspace',
  repoSlug: 'main-application',
  title: 'Database connection timeout',
  content: 'Users experiencing connection timeouts during peak hours',
  kind: 'bug',
  priority: 'major',
  assignee: 'lead-developer',
  accessToken: process.env.BITBUCKET_TOKEN
});
```
