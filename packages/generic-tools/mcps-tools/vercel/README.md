# Vercel MCP Tool

## Overview

Production-ready Vercel platform integration tool implementing Model Context Protocol for comprehensive deployment management and serverless application operations. Provides complete Vercel API coverage with advanced deployment analytics, edge function monitoring, and performance optimization capabilities.

## Supported helpers (fixtures)

This package wraps the following async helpers from `@engi/vercel` in the `Tool` primitive so they can be surfaced over MCP:

- `vercelGetDeploymentTool`
- `vercelGetDeploymentEventsTool`
- `vercelListDeploymentsTool`
- `vercelGetDeploymentBuildLogsTool`
- `vercelListProjectsTool`
- `vercelGetProjectTool`
- `vercelListTeamsTool`
- `vercelSearchDocumentationTool`
- `vercelDeployProjectTool`
- `vercelBuyDomainTool`
- `vercelCheckDomainAvailabilityTool`

They return deterministic fixture data that mirrors Vercel’s public MCP endpoints, enabling the ChatGPT demo to showcase believable responses without live credentials.
