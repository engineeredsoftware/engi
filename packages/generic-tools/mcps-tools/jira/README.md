## Configuration

### Connection Setup
```typescript
interface JiraToolContext {
  user_id: string;              // User identifier for connection lookup
  connection?: JiraConnection;  // Optional direct connection override
}

interface JiraConnection {
  auth_type: 'oauth' | 'token'; // Authentication method
  base_url: string;             // Jira instance URL
  access_token: string;         // Authentication token
  refresh_token?: string;       // OAuth refresh token
  expires_at?: Date;            // Token expiration time
}
```

### Authentication Configuration
- **OAuth Setup**: Client ID, secret, and redirect URI configuration
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and renewal
- **Instance Discovery**: Automatic Jira instance detection and configuration
- **Security Compliance**: HTTPS enforcement and credential encryption

### Operation Parameters
