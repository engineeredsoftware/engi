# AWS Location Services MCP Tool

## Overview

Industrial Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for Amazon Location Service operations. Enables geospatial query processing and location-based analytics through standardized MCP protocol interface.

## Core Capabilities

### Geospatial Query Processing
- Point-in-polygon spatial queries
- Distance-based location filtering
- Radius search operations
- Geographic boundary analysis

### Location Intelligence
- Place search and geocoding
- Reverse geocoding operations
- Route calculation and optimization
- Geofencing and proximity alerts

## MCP Operations

| Operation | Function | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `awsLocationGeospatialQueryTool` | Geospatial query execution | Process location-based queries against AWS Location Service |

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Pattern
```typescript
import { awsLocationGeospatialQueryTool } from '@engi/generic-tools-mcps-aws-location';

// Execute geospatial query
const locationResults = await awsLocationGeospatialQueryTool({
  queryType: 'proximity',
  coordinates: [longitude, latitude],
  radius: 5000,
  placeIndex: 'production-places',
  filters: {
    category: 'restaurant',
    minRating: 4.0
  }
});
```
