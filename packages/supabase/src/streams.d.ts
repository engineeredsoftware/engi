 * best-effort – a failed insert will throw to the caller so pipeline logic
 * can surface the failure to the user.
 *
 * To avoid the overhead of a network round-trip for each chunk the
 * implementation buffers events for a short window (default 100 ms or a
 * max batch size) and then performs a single `insert([...])` statement.
