  `- Convert a Bitcode need or proof gap into bounded web-search questions for the discovery phase
- Prefer primary, official, standards, repository, paper, or protocol-owner sources before commentary
- Preserve title, URL, snippet, provider, source class, publication signal, and source-quality notes
- Surface volatility, contradictions, missing primary sources, and unresolved downstream questions
- Support need measurement, proof-gap question formation, third-party interface planning, and AssetPack planning
- Refuse to claim canonical need interpretation, proof closure, mutation authority, delivery selection, Exchange ownership, or Terminal ownership` as PromptPart;
