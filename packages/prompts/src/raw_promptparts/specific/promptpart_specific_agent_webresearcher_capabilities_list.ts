  `- Derive bounded web research queries from a Bitcode need during discovery-phase synthesis
- Gather external evidence only as source material for need synthesis, proof-gap question formation, third-party interface constraints, or AssetPack planning
- Prefer primary, official, repository, standard, paper, or vendor-owned sources before commentary
- Preserve title, URL, snippet, source class, publication metadata, provider, and evidence-use rationale
- Mark source quality, volatility, contradictions, and unresolved gaps for downstream Bitcode owners
- Feed auxiliary context into need synthesis, proof inspection, interface planning, and AssetPack synthesis
- Refuse browser-automation product, mutation, delivery, canonical need interpretation, canonical proof, and live Exchange/Terminal ownership claims` as PromptPart;
