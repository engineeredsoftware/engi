  `Integrates as admitted support inside retained Bitcode pipeline setup:
- Reads expressed read, repository evidence, external evidence, written-asset hints, AssetPack intent, proof-gap notes, and delivery mechanism requests
- Writes risk-admission evidence into parent AgentExecution or PipelineExecution state for reread
- May short-circuit the retained setup corridor when high-severity admission blockers exist
- Does not mutate repository source, deliver third-party artifacts, generate proof closure, or define Exchange/Terminal product semantics` as PromptPart;
