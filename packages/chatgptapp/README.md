# @bitcode/chatgptapp

Bitcode’s ChatGPT App MCP package lets product-minded builders ship software without touching a code editor. Inside a single ChatGPT thread, Bitcode captures your intent, keeps AI design documents truthful, narrates repository behaviour in plain language, drafts implementation moves, and coordinates GitHub plus DevOps changes with explicit confirmation.

> Docs live alongside the package for consistency. Use this README for positioning + tool catalog, skim `TLDR.md` to get oriented in under a minute, check `TODO.md` for the active backlog, and follow `DEMO.md` to rehearse the Yapper launch video.

## Product framing

- **Audience** – Semi-technical builders (founders, product leads, architects) who can articulate intent but prefer AI to execute.
- **Promise** – “Design software conversationally, let Bitcode ship it.” Every artifact lives in `.ai/PRODUCT.md`, `.ai/AGENTS.md`, or committed code, with attribution and history.
- **Relationship to Codex** – Codex remains the editing IDE for expert engineers. Bitcode owns the design-first loop, keeps state synchronised, and triggers write operations with explicit confirmation.
- **AI Documents** – Templates for `.ai/PRODUCT.md` and `.ai/AGENTS.md` ship inside `src/tools.ts`; sessions create and evolve them via the `design_code`, `code_design`, and `improve_developing_behavior` tools.

## Why Bitcode (landing narrative)

The pre-launch landing page and demo video revolve around three promises:

1. **Design-first control** – Capture every requirement as you talk. Bitcode turns them into structured updates inside `.ai/PRODUCT.md`, so intent stays visible and portable.
2. **Explain-before-you-edit** – Before any code changes land, Bitcode narrates the relevant files, drafts a plan, and shows diff-ready stubs. You steer scope; Bitcode handles detail.
3. **Ship with receipts** – GitHub commits, Vercel deploys, and AWS tweaks only happen with confirmation. Every decision is mirrored into `.ai/AGENTS.md` for future sessions.

The headline: *“Design your app in chat. Bitcode keeps the documents honest, drafts the code, and ships it when you say go.”*

## Local dev workflow

```bash
# install dependencies (workspace root)
pnpm install

# start Bitcode MCP server (logs muted for inspector)
BITCODE_LOG_STDOUT=0 pnpm --silent --filter @bitcode/chatgptapp start

# optional: hot reload during development
pnpm --filter @bitcode/chatgptapp dev
```

> Environment variables in `.env` / `.env.local` files (repo root or any parent directory) are auto-loaded before tools initialise, so flags like `BITCODE_MOCK_EXA=true` take effect without exporting them manually.

## Using the MCP Inspector

1. **Start the server** in one terminal:
   ```bash
   BITCODE_LOG_STDOUT=0 pnpm --silent --filter @bitcode/chatgptapp start
   ```
2. **Launch the inspector UI** in another terminal:
   ```bash
   pnpm exec mcp-inspector
   ```
   This prints a session token and opens http://localhost:6274 with the token pre-filled.
3. If the STDIO panel shows an old command (e.g. `--stdio-command`), clear the inspector’s cached config:
   - Browser DevTools → `localStorage.clear()` + reload; or use the gear icon → “Clear STDIO configuration”.
4. Connect via STDIO:
   - Command: `pnpm`
   - Arguments: `--silent`, `--filter=@bitcode/chatgptapp`, `start`
   - Environment: `BITCODE_LOG_STDOUT=0`
   - Click **Connect** (optionally tick “Remember”).

The `tools/list` call should display the canonical identifiers below (no `engi:` prefix).

## Canonical tools

| Tool | Purpose | Example prompt | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `answer_codebase_query` | Run high-signal repository searches and answer targeted questions. | “Bitcode, where do we validate Yapper posts before save?” | Returns newline-delimited hits plus structured metadata. |
| `answer_codeweb_query` | Research external references, examples, or docs. | “Bitcode, find guidance on building optimistic UI timelines.” | Defaults to Exa search; honours `BITCODE_MOCK_EXA`. |
| `depict_design_asset` | Describe screenshots/diagrams for later recall. | “Bitcode, narrate this wireframe—focus on onboarding.” | Accepts base64 assets, optional focus and notes. |
| `design_code` | Update `.ai/PRODUCT.md` from conversational ideas. | “Bitcode, add a flow for muting noisy Yapper feeds.” | Creates the doc if missing, appends a `### Proposed Updates` block; set `regenerateFromDigest: true` to refresh the baseline via `@bitcode/digest`. |
| `code_design` | Translate design updates into actionable implementation steps. | “Bitcode, draft the edits to implement the mute-feed feature.” | Emits task bullets and patch stubs for targeted files. |
| `read_code_changes_from_vcs` | Summarise recent GitHub activity for a repo/branch. | “Bitcode, what shipped on `main` over the last five commits?” | Requires repo-scoped token; outputs author-tagged lines. |
| `write_code_changes_to_vcs` | Create repositories or push file updates. | “Bitcode, commit the generated Yapper seed data to `main`.” | Confirmation-gated; leverages Octokit for file writes. |
| `improve_developing_behavior` | Capture collaboration learnings in `.ai/AGENTS.md`. | “Bitcode, note that we always reference file paths with line numbers.” | Returns both the delta block and the latest agent doc; set `regenerateFromDigest: true` to refresh via `@bitcode/digest`. |
| `use_vercel_read_external_mcp` | Narrate Vercel teams, projects, deployments, or docs. | “Bitcode, list deployments for Yapper and flag the prod URL.” | Payload: `request` (e.g. `list_deployments`) + `payload` (tool args). |
| `use_vercel_write_external_mcp` | Demo Vercel mutations (deploy, domains) with believable fixtures. | “Bitcode, kick off a fresh preview deploy—confirm with me first.” | Returns realistic responses while reminding viewers to use real creds live. |
| `use_aws_read_external_mcp` | Run AWS health checks (Lambda invoke, S3/Dynamo reads, CloudWatch logs). | “Bitcode, run the `yap-transcribe` lambda and share the response.” | Payload: `request` (e.g. `lambda.invoke`) + `payload` (CLI-style args). |
| `use_aws_write_external_mcp` | Apply scoped AWS writes with confirmation (S3 uploads, Dynamo inserts). | “Bitcode, upload the Yapper demo config to S3—confirm first.” | Emits success fixtures and nudges users to document the impact in PRODUCT.md. |

Refer to `TLDR.md` for a quick-start checklist and `TODO.md` for the active backlog.

## Prompt playbook

**Golden prompts**

1. “Bitcode, I’d like to create a new application repository for [purpose].”
2. “Bitcode, I’d like to update my application’s software to add [feature].”
3. “Bitcode, I need to fix a bug—the errors I’m seeing are […].”
4. “Bitcode, I want my application to do [expected] but I’m seeing [actual]; what might be causing it?”
5. “Bitcode, I need to learn about [component] of the codebase—summarise it for me.”
6. “Bitcode, use [third-party DevOps tool] to [action].”

**Indirect prompts**

1. “How is our base Button React component implemented?”
2. “We’re tracing a regression but can’t find the cause—where should we look?”
3. “I’m unfamiliar with this code…”
4. “Let’s build more of our software!”
5. “I want to build an app.”

**Negative prompts** (decline gracefully)

- “Let’s talk about favorite ice cream flavors.”
- “What is the weather today?”
- “Tell me about history, geography, or art.”
- “I don’t have a codebase and I don’t want to work with software.”

## AI document support

- `design_code` seeds or evolves `.ai/PRODUCT.md` using design-first bullet updates.
- `code_design` converts those updates into numbered tasks plus patch scaffolds ready for review.
- `improve_developing_behavior` keeps `.ai/AGENTS.md` aligned with how we prefer to work.

All templates live in `src/tools.ts` so new sessions can bootstrap immediately.

## Demo and script

- See `DEMO.md` for the full Yapper walkthrough (user turn, Bitcode reasoning summary, tool invocation, and representative output).
- The script exercises each tool exactly once so the recording captures the full capability surface.

## QA checklist

1. **MCP Inspector**
   - Start the server: `BITCODE_LOG_STDOUT=0 pnpm --silent --filter @bitcode/chatgptapp start`.
   - Launch the inspector: `pnpm exec mcp-inspector`.
   - Clear cached STDIO config if necessary.
   - Call every tool with sample payloads to validate schema + output shapes.
2. **ChatGPT (Apps SDK developer mode)**
   - Install the Bitcode MCP pointing to the local server.
   - Follow the `DEMO.md` script verbatim; confirm each tool responds as expected.
   - Ensure confirmation prompts fire for `write_code_changes_to_vcs`, `use_vercel_write_external_mcp`, and `use_aws_write_external_mcp`.
3. **App metadata review**
   - Align App Store copy and screenshots with the tool list above.
   - Verify environment variables (`EXA_API_KEY`, AWS creds, GitHub tokens) before filming.
