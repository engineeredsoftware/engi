## Version executive summary

V40 exists to make Bitcode's commercial application tests deep enough to sustain enterprise shippability.
V39 promoted the commercial Reading product path; V40 turns that path and the surrounding system into an exhaustively validated product surface.
The version must cover real user interactions, state possibilities, accessible UI behavior, generated proof artifacts, route contracts, package primitives, pipeline integrations, ledger/database/storage synchronization, and local/staging rehearsal.

V40 also prepares V41 by making prompt and PromptPart benchmarks measurable in ordinary quality flows.
V41 remains the singular prompts-as-programs version after V40, focused on every raw PromptPart, composed Prompt, benchmark, semantic division, title, template, interpolation contract, registry binding, and inference callsite.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode remains the protocol and commercial system for depositing technical knowledge, reading needs against the Depository, finding many fitting deposits, synthesizing source-safe AssetPack previews, settling BTC fees, transferring BTD rights, and delivering full source-bearing AssetPacks only after settlement.
V40 does not change that economic or protocol law.
It proves the law through better tests.

## V40 source-of-truth hierarchy

`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to `V39` while V40 is draft.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V39.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V39_PROVEN.md` are active canon.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V40.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V40_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V40_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V40_PARITY_MATRIX.md` define the draft target only on `version/v40` and `v40/gate-*` branches.
Implementation remains unversioned in source paths; routes, packages, tests, and components must move in place.

## V40 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

Every V40 test must bind to source truth, not screenshots or mocks alone.
Browser tests must prove UI behavior and state transitions.
Integration tests must prove that separately owned primitives compose correctly.
Unit tests must prove isolated behavior for packages, primitives, and interface-specific implementations.
Generated artifacts must record what was tested, what was intentionally skipped, and which failures fail closed.

## V40 totality and precision enforcement rule

Testing is not ceremonial in V40.
Each gate must name the product surface, state matrix, source files, commands, generated artifact, and failure mode it closes.
Assertions must be typed or structurally parsed whenever possible.
Snapshot and screenshot comparisons must be deterministic enough to review.
Networked and credentialed checks must have local, staging-testnet, and opt-in production-mainnet lanes.

## V40 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- Expand E2E, visual, screenshot, interaction, accessibility, responsive, API, integration, unit, and proof coverage across the commercial application.
- Make V39 Reading confidence testable from Request Read through Need review, Finding Fits, preview, settlement, rights transfer, delivery, and repair.
- Make pipeline primitives testable both as primitives and as the real `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` and `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` implementations.
- Make conversations, Terminal, Auxillaries, Exchange, MCP API, ChatGPT App, public API, ledger/database/storage synchronization, and protocol-demonstration regressions greenable.
- Prepare V41 prompt benchmarking by ensuring prompt fixtures and benchmark commands are runnable in CI lanes.

Non-goals:

- V40 does not rewrite prompts, PromptParts, or inference text as the main work; V41 owns that focused evolution.
- V40 does not change BTD supply law, BTC settlement law, or unpaid AssetPack disclosure boundaries.
- V40 does not introduce versioned source routes.

Design principles: source-grounded tests, deterministic proofs, fail-closed fixtures, clear lane separation, commercial realism, and maintainable test architecture.

## V40 system architecture and layer boundaries

V40 tests the existing layers:

- protocol and BTD packages;
- prompt, agent, tool, execution, and pipeline primitives;
- Reading pipeline real implementations;
- API and UAPI route boundaries;
- Terminal, Conversations, Auxillaries, Exchange, MCP API, ChatGPT App, public API, and documentation surfaces;
- ledger, database, object storage, VCS, wallet, sandbox, and deployment lane projections;
- demonstration code as a self-contained minimal implementation.

Tests may depend downward on public package APIs and source-safe fixtures.
Tests may not import demonstration code into commercial code, may not reveal secrets, may not expose unpaid AssetPack source, and may not bypass authorization, settlement, or disclosure controls.

## V40 canonical domain model

V40 keeps the V39 domain model: deposits, Depository supply records, Read Requests, synthesized Needs, accepted Need admission, candidate fit deposits, selected fits, AssetPack previews, quotes, BTC payment observations, BTD rights transfer, source-to-shares compensation, post-settlement delivery, ledger/database/storage receipts, telemetry, repair actions, and generated proof artifacts.
Testing domain objects add scenario matrices, fixture manifests, replay transcripts, screenshot baselines, accessibility reports, API contract receipts, integration receipts, unit coverage maps, benchmark receipts, and promotion-readiness reports.

## V40 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V40 operator chain is: author a scenario, seed source-safe fixtures, run unit tests, run integration tests, run browser and visual tests, run route/API tests, run pipeline and conversation tests, run ledger/database/storage synchronization tests, run local/staging rehearsal, inspect generated artifacts, repair failures, and only then promote canon.
Every chain step must produce a deterministic or explicitly lane-bound receipt.

## V40 canonical subsystem surfaces

### Depositing and asset supply

Current canonical objects and emitted artifacts: deposits, Depository supply records, measurement roots, source-safe search documents, vector projections, storage readbacks, and test fixtures.

## V40 generated canon

### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

V40 inherits reproducible canon requirements from prior promoted Bitcode and ENGI specs.

### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

V40 inherits operator-quality artifact expectations for readable proof and repair evidence.

### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| Artifact | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v40-spec-family-report.json` | protocol canonical package | draft spec family validation |
| `.bitcode/v40-canonical-input-report.json` | protocol canonical package | draft canonical input accounting |
| `.bitcode/v40-promotion-readiness-report.json` | future V40 promotion gate | promotion readiness |

### V40 specifying generated artifacts

V40 generated artifacts begin with `.bitcode/v40-spec-family-report.json` and `.bitcode/v40-canonical-input-report.json`.
Later gates add browser, visual, integration, unit, disclosure, synchronization, prompt benchmark smoke, and promotion-readiness artifacts.

### Shared generated-artifact fields

Shared fields include artifact id, schema id, version, current target, source roots, generated timestamp, proof-source commit, aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, and fail closed when a required source or artifact is missing.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Artifact-specific fields include scenario ids, route ids, component ids, package ids, primitive ids, pipeline ids, prompt ids, PromptPart ids, benchmark ids, screenshot roots, coverage roots, ledger roots, storage roots, and repair roots.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

Artifacts are public, buyer, reviewer, internal, or secret-bearing.
No V40 public artifact may include credentials, protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, raw protected prompts, raw provider responses, or private wallet material.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The generated appendix must render aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when required evidence is missing.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Canonical regeneration must be deterministic.
Missing generated artifacts, stale reports, malformed JSON, invalid screenshots, unparseable route responses, unbound tests, stale promoted status truth, or uncovered critical surfaces fail closed.

## V40 validation canon

Validation canon includes `pnpm run check:v40-gate1`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V40 --mode draft --current-target V39`, `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V39 --draft-target V40`, package typechecks, protocol tests, route/API tests, browser E2E suites, visual/screenshot proof suites, integration suites, unit suites, prompt benchmark smoke tests, local/staging rehearsal commands, and diff hygiene.

## V40 promotion canon

V40 promotion requires all V40 gates to close, V40 proof support to exist, V40 workflows to be green, and the promotion commit to update `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` from `V39` to `V40`.
Promotion must also leave V41 as the next draft target focused on prompts as programs.

## V40 appendices and canonical supporting material

### Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Canonical types include deposits, Reads, Needs, fits, AssetPacks, BTD ranges, ledger receipts, database projections, object-storage receipts, `PipelineExecution`, PTRR receipts, `FailsafeGenerationSequence`, `ThricifiedGeneration`, `ToolExecution`, PromptParts, Prompts, tests, fixtures, screenshots, traces, coverage reports, and generated proof artifacts.

The generated artifact contract catalog is the V40 generated canon above.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

Minimum contents are aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when required evidence is missing.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Regeneration fails closed on malformed artifacts, stale reports, missing source roots, or stale promoted status truth.

### Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

V40 gates must progressively add greenable commands for browser E2E, visual screenshots, API integration, pipeline integration, conversation integration, ledger/storage synchronization, unit coverage, prompt benchmark smoke, local/staging rehearsal, and promotion readiness.

## V40 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

Accepted boundaries: V40 may expand test architecture, coverage, artifacts, fixtures, browser proof, visual proof, integration suites, and unit suites. V40 may add prompt benchmark smoke coverage, but V41 owns the focused prompt and PromptPart audit, repartitioning, retitling, rewriting, and benchmark-quality elevation.

Reopen conditions: evidence of untested critical flows, brittle visual tests, route contract gaps, source leakage in tests, secrets in tracked files, pipeline primitive bypass, ungreenable CI, stale generated artifacts, or V41 prompt work leaking backward into V40 as unbounded scope.

## V40 completion condition

V40 is complete only when its gates make exhaustive commercial application testing greenable and promotion-grade across browser E2E, visual/screenshot, API, integration, unit, pipeline, conversation, ledger/database/storage, local/staging, prompt benchmark smoke, proof artifact, and promotion workflow surfaces, while leaving V41 clearly scoped to prompts as programs.
