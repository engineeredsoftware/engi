## Version executive summary

V47 is the final commercial-readiness version before Bitcode can deploy a
complete staging-testnet website experience for the first generally available
MVP. It narrows launch scope to the rich website application: `/deposit`,
`/read`, `/packs`, and Auxillaries for identity, connections, wallets,
organizations, and histories.

V47 does not make mainnet value-bearing claims. In V47, "testnet" means one
thing: BTC amounts and settlement observations are testnet only, making the
commercial transaction economically free while the rest of the system behaves
as production-intended. Source-safe AssetPack synthesis, Depository admission,
Finding Fits, preview, quote, BTD rights, delivery, proof readback,
ledger/database/storage synchronization, and repair states must be real enough
for commercial demonstration.

Measurement is the key commercial primitive. V47 requires a clear measurement
catalog, prompt ownership, typed measurement output, weights, weighted scalar
BTD formula, and seller/buyer visualization so IP sellers can decide what to
deposit and IP buyers can decide what to buy without source leakage.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode commoditizes knowledge by packaging source, documents, data, workflows,
and other technical materials as AssetPacks. Depositors supply AssetPacks into
the Depository. Readers ask Bitcode to understand a Read Request, synthesize a
Need, find fitting Depository AssetPacks, synthesize a Need-Fit AssetPack,
preview source-safe measurements, settle in BTC, receive BTD rights, and receive
entitled repository delivery.

BTD is the weighted scalar knowledge-volume measured from source bits, bytes,
content, documents, code, and other knowledge-bearing material. BTD can be
estimated for deposit-side AssetPack options, but final BTD size is
Need-relative: it is computed from measurements against a reviewed Need and
bound to settlement, rights, delivery, and source-to-shares compensation.

V47 makes the website experience commercially demonstrable on staging-testnet
by proving both sides of the exchange: IP sellers can deposit AssetPacks, and IP
buyers can buy Need-fitting AssetPacks.

## V47 source-of-truth hierarchy

`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to `V46`; V46 is the active promoted Bitcode canon.
`BITCODE_SPEC_V47.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V47_DELTA.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V47_NOTES.md`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V47_PARITY_MATRIX.md` are draft
V47 material until V47 promotion. V47 authorizes implementation only gate by
gate through accepted parity, generated proof artifacts, tests, and promotion
readiness.

Implementation remains unversioned in source paths. Routes, packages,
components, tests, prompts, telemetry, schemas, APIs, and workflows continue to
move in place as the single current Bitcode system after V47 gates authorize
their changes.

## V47 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V47 must be reconstructable from this draft family, source code, generated
artifacts, proof roots, workflow receipts, ledger journals, database
projections, object-storage roots, wallet/provider receipts, repository
delivery receipts, and source-safe telemetry.

No V47 surface may disclose protected source, unpaid AssetPack source, raw
prompts, raw model/provider responses, credentials, wallet private material,
private settlement payloads, private repository access, or source-bearing
delivery contents before entitlement.

## V47 totality and precision enforcement rule

V47 must preserve V46 protocol comprehension while becoming operationally
complete for the website launch. AssetPack is the commodity. BTD is weighted
scalar knowledge-volume and, after settlement, a rights-bearing receipt. BTC is
settlement money, testnet-only in V47 deployment. Source-to-shares is
post-finality contributor allocation. Measurement is the basis for price.
Preview is not source disclosure. Quote is not payment. Payment observation is
not finality. Database projection is not ledger truth when stronger evidence
conflicts.

Every user-visible state must name whether it is estimate, potential, preview,
quote, observed testnet payment, final settlement, rights transfer, delivery,
contributor allocation, compensation, or repair.

## V47 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- Launch-freeze the first generally available website MVP scope.
- Make `/deposit`, `/read`, `/packs`, and Auxillaries commercially coherent on
  staging-testnet.
- Specify seller and buyer user flows with exact state machines.
- Specify measurement law: catalog, prompts, typed outputs, weights, BTD scalar
  formula, proof roots, and source-safe visualizations.
- Audit feature excess and defer or flag anything that distracts from launch.
- Treat `/deposit`, `/read`, and `/packs` as the website launch entrypoints;
  route `/exchange` compatibility into `/packs`; keep `/terminal`,
  `/conversations`, API/MCP, ChatGPT App, Bitcode Chat, value-bearing mainnet,
  and advanced market mechanics out of the launch path unless a later gate
  explicitly reopens them.
- Prove E2E IP selling and IP buying through browser-level commercial tests.
- Refurbish the landing page and public launch messaging for V47 testnet
  readiness.

Non-goals:

- V47 does not launch value-bearing mainnet BTC settlement.
- V47 does not commercialize Bitcode Chat, ChatGPT App, or MCP/API beyond
  source-safe compatibility and future-readiness boundaries.
- V47 does not finish deeper BTD mining cryptography beyond the website launch
  contract.
- V47 does not expose unpaid source or source-bearing prompts.
- V47 does not add advanced market mechanics beyond MVP selling and buying.

Design principles: measurement before price, price before settlement,
settlement before source unlock, source safety before convenience, website
clarity before advanced interfaces, proof-backed readback before projection,
and testnet value semantics without weakening production-like system behavior.

## V47 system architecture and layer boundaries

V47 acts through the website application:

- Auxillaries owns user identity, organizations, teams, wallets, source
  connections, target repository connections, and histories.
- `/deposit` owns IP-seller source connection, deposit AssetPack option
  synthesis, source-safe option review, Depository admission, and compensation
  expectation readback.
- `/read` owns IP-buyer Read Request, ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis,
  Need review/resynthesis, ReadFitsFindingSynthesis, source-safe preview,
  quote, BTC-testnet settlement, BTD rights transfer, and repository delivery.
- `/packs` owns searchable master-detail PackActivity across deposits, reads,
  previews, quotes, settlements, rights, delivery, compensation, repairs, proof
  roots, and histories.
- API/MCP, ChatGPT App, and Bitcode Chat remain deferred commercial surfaces in
  V47, though their source-safe contracts must not regress.

## V47 canonical domain model

Canonical V47 launch objects:

- IP seller, IP buyer, organization, team, wallet, BTC-testnet account,
  source connection, target repository connection, deposit source bundle,
  deposit AssetPack option, Depository AssetPack, Read Request, synthesized
  Need, accepted Need, Fit candidate set, selected Fit set, Need-Fit AssetPack,
  source-safe preview, measurement vector, measurement weight policy,
  weighted BTD scalar, BTC-testnet quote, settlement receipt, BTD rights
  receipt, repository delivery receipt, source-to-shares allocation,
  compensation statement, PackActivity row, proof root, repair case, and
  commercial rehearsal receipt.

Canonical V47 states:

- Seller states: `seller-connected`, `source-connected`,
  `deposit-options-synthesizing`, `deposit-option-synthesized`,
  `deposit-option-reviewed`, `deposit-option-approved`,
  `depository-admission-submitted`, `depository-assetpack-admitted`,
  `compensation-eligible`, `seller-repair-required`.
- Buyer states: `buyer-connected`, `target-repository-connected`,
  `read-requested`, `read-need-synthesizing`, `read-need-reviewing`,
  `read-need-accepted`, `finding-fits-running`, `fits-found`,
  `need-fit-assetpack-synthesized`, `source-safe-preview-reviewing`,
  `btc-testnet-quote-issued`, `btc-testnet-settlement-observed`,
  `btd-rights-transferred`, `repository-delivery-created`,
  `buyer-repair-required`.
- Pack states: `pack-activity-created`, `measurement-visualized`,
  `proof-root-bound`, `ledger-projected`, `database-synchronized`,
  `storage-root-bound`, `repair-opened`, `repair-closed`.

## V47 measurement law

Measurement is the singular key to valuable IP commoditization and exchange.
Every V47 sale or deposit decision must be grounded in source-safe measurement
readback.

Measurement catalog:

- Coverage measurement: how much of the Need or deposit option is addressed.
- Specificity measurement: how precise the AssetPack is relative to a Need or
  supply opportunity.
- Novelty measurement: how much non-public or hard-to-recreate knowledge the
  AssetPack contains without exposing source.
- Reuse measurement: how likely the AssetPack is to help future Reads.
- Risk measurement: source criticality, leakage risk, rights risk, and repair
  risk.
- Evidence measurement: proof-root, test, benchmark, repository, telemetry, and
  provenance support.
- Fit measurement: Need-relative alignment across candidate Fits.
- Delivery measurement: confidence that the synthesized AssetPack can be
  delivered as a repository PR or equivalent entitled delivery.

Measurement prompt rule:

- Each measurement must be commanded by a named Prompt or PromptPart composition
  through the existing prompt registry.
- Each inference-owned measurement must record its input context class, source
  boundary, prompt template identity, interpolated prompt hash or source-safe
  digest, typed output schema, parsed result, proof root, telemetry receipt,
  and repair posture.
- Raw protected prompts, raw provider responses, protected source, and unpaid
  AssetPack source remain private. Source-safe prompt identity, prompt digest,
  typed measurement result, and proof root are disclosable.

Weighted scalar BTD formula:

- Each measurement emits `measurementVolume`, `confidence`, `riskAdjustment`,
  and `weight`.
- Normalized contribution is
  `measurementVolume * confidence * riskAdjustment * weight`.
- Deposit-side BTD is an estimated or potential BTD range because no reviewed
  buyer Need is bound yet.
- Read-side BTD is the final Need-relative weighted scalar knowledge-volume
  after measurement policy lock, Need acceptance, Fit selection, and quote
  binding.
- The sum of normalized contributions becomes the BTD scalar used for quote,
  rights, delivery, and source-to-shares accounting.

Seller visualization:

- Depositors must see source-safe measurements for criticality, likely demand,
  reuse value, evidence, estimated BTD range, ROI posture, compensation
  expectation, source-safety blockers, and repair requirements before approving
  deposit.

Buyer visualization:

- Readers must see source-safe measurements for Need coverage, Fit confidence,
  selected Fit provenance, novelty, risk, delivery readiness, quote basis,
  final BTD scalar, and repair blockers before paying BTC-testnet settlement.

Measurement theorem:

No measurement, no price. No price, no settlement. No settlement, no market.

## V47 whole Bitcode operator chain

1. Seller connects identity, wallet, organization, and source.
2. Bitcode synthesizes source-safe deposit AssetPack options.
3. Seller reviews measurements and approves an option for Depository admission.
4. Depository indexes admitted AssetPack metadata, measurements, embeddings,
   proof roots, and compensation posture.
5. Buyer connects identity, wallet, organization, and target repository.
6. Buyer requests a Read.
7. Bitcode synthesizes a Need and the buyer accepts or resynthesizes it.
8. Bitcode runs Finding Fits against the Depository.
9. Bitcode synthesizes a Need-Fit AssetPack and source-safe preview.
10. Buyer reviews measurements, quote, and proof posture.
11. Buyer settles with BTC-testnet.
12. Bitcode transfers BTD rights, unlocks entitled delivery, creates the
    repository PR, journals compensation, and synchronizes `/packs`.
13. Operators repair only through proof-backed state transitions.

## V47 generated canon

### Appendix C. Generated artifact contract catalog

#### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

`.bitcode/v19-contract-change-ledger.json`,
`.bitcode/v19-negative-proof-mutation-matrix.json`,
`.bitcode/v19-proof-member-semantic-matrix.json`,
`.bitcode/v19-theorem-evidence-matrix.json`,
`.bitcode/v19-state-machine-matrix.json`,
`.bitcode/v19-deterministic-replay-report.json`, and
`.bitcode/v19-volatility-inventory.json` remain historical reproducibility
inputs.

#### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

`.bitcode/v20-operator-acceptance-transcript.json`,
`.bitcode/v20-visual-regression-report.json`,
`.bitcode/v20-accessibility-report.json`,
`.bitcode/v20-performance-budget-report.json`,
`.bitcode/v20-projection-quality-smoke-matrix.json`,
`.bitcode/v20-quality-summary.json`, and `ENGI_SPEC_V20_PROVEN.md` remain
historical operator-quality inputs.

#### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| artifactPath | role | disclosability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v47-spec-family-report.json` | V47 spec-family validation report | source-safe |
| `.bitcode/v47-canonical-input-report.json` | V47 canonical-input validation report | source-safe |
| `BITCODE_SPEC_V47_PROVEN.md` | V47 generated proof appendix after promotion readiness | source-safe |

#### V47 specifying generated artifacts

V47 Gate 1 reserves `.bitcode/v47-spec-family-report.json` and
`.bitcode/v47-canonical-input-report.json`. Later gates may add launch,
measurement, route, and E2E rehearsal artifacts.

#### Shared generated-artifact fields

All V47 generated artifacts must carry artifact id, version, generatedAt or
deterministic marker, source roots, proof root, source-safety verdict,
predicate results, aggregate proof verdict, and repair posture.

#### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Measurement artifacts must include measurement ids, weights, normalized
contributions, prompt identities, typed output schemas, visualization fields,
and source-safety denials.

#### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

V47 artifacts classify fields as public, operator, buyer, reviewer, internal,
source-bearing, secret, or denied.

#### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The generated appendix must render aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family
inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem
inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact
inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices,
proof-source commit, and fail closed when conditions.

#### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Regeneration must fail closed when source roots drift, proof roots mismatch,
generated artifact inventories are incomplete, scenario and run coverage
matrices are stale, proof-source commit is missing, or source-safety scans fail.

## V47 validation canon

V47 Gate 1 validation requires:

- `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V46 --mode promoted --current-target V46`
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V47 --mode draft --current-target V46`
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V46`
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V46 --draft-target V47`
- `node scripts/check-v47-gate1-scope-measurement-launch-freeze.mjs --skip-branch-check`

Later gates must add focused tests, browser E2E, proof generation, staging
rehearsal, and promotion readiness checks.

## V47 promotion canon

V47 may promote only after all gates close, all generated artifacts are fresh,
all commercial website launch tests are green, staging-testnet rehearsal proves
seller and buyer E2E flows, and the maintained promotion workflow advances
`BITCODE_SPEC.txt` to `V47`.

## V47 appendices and canonical supporting material

### Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Canonical surfaces are `/deposit`, `/read`, `/packs`, Auxillaries, Depository
indexes, proof roots, workflow receipts, ledger journals, database projections,
object-storage roots, wallet/provider receipts, and repository delivery
receipts. API/MCP, ChatGPT App, and Bitcode Chat remain compatibility surfaces
for V47, not commercial launch scope.

### Appendix B. Proof family closure catalog

The nine proof families above close through measurement, state-machine,
disclosure, settlement, delivery, repair, and promotion evidence.

### Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

V47 gates:

1. Scope, Testnet Semantics, Measurement Law, And Launch Freeze.
2. Feature Excess And Gate Alignment Audit. Gate 2 owns
   `.bitcode/v47-feature-excess-alignment-audit.json`, the
   `buildV47FeatureExcessAlignmentAudit` package object, and
   `check:v47-gate2`.
3. Seller And Buyer State Machine Law. Gate 3 owns
   `.bitcode/v47-seller-buyer-state-machine-law.json`, the
   `buildV47SellerBuyerStateMachineLaw` package object, and
   `check:v47-gate3`.
4. Depositor Website Completion.
5. Reader Website Completion.
6. Packs And Auxillaries Commercial Dashboard.
7. E2E IP Selling And Buying Tests.
8. Landing Page And Public Launch Messaging.
9. Staging-Testnet Deployment Rehearsal.
10. Promotion Readiness.

### Appendix E. Current canonical source map

Current source map roots include `uapi`, `packages/btd`,
`packages/pipeline-asset-pack`, `packages/pipeline-hosts`,
`packages/protocol`, `packages/prompts`, `packages/executions-mcp`,
`packages/chatgptapp`, `protocol-demonstration`, `.github/workflows`, and
`.bitcode` generated artifacts.

V47 Gate 2 source-safe generated artifact:
`.bitcode/v47-feature-excess-alignment-audit.json`. It records launch routes,
supporting surfaces, deferred surfaces, feature policies, forbidden launch
entry targets, source-safe payload boundaries, source-root digests, and
predicate results without serializing source, prompt payloads, wallet private
material, settlement private payloads, or mainnet value-bearing authority.

V47 Gate 3 source-safe generated artifact:
`.bitcode/v47-seller-buyer-state-machine-law.json`. It records IP seller
states, IP buyer states, transition guards, measurement ids, source-safe field
ids, forbidden payload classes, source-root digests, and predicate results.
The law requires measurement-before-price, proof-before-state, accepted Need
before Finding Fits, quote-before-settlement, BTC finality before BTD rights,
BTD rights before source delivery, `/packs` history projection after each
transition, and fail-closed repair on missing evidence.

### Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

Required coverage phrases: repo supply and depositing; reading and measured
demand; prompt/inference/evaluator ownership; deposit-to-read fit; recall and
ranking; verification decisions; selection and materialization; branch
artifacts and assetPackEvidence; identity, authority, signing, and policy;
sensitive data and confidentiality flows; projection, disclosure, and
redaction; proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay;
settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting; telemetry,
persistence, state, and failure semantics; host/runtime capability truth;
operator experience and pedagogy; validation and test stack; generated
artifacts and canonical promotion.

### Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

The V47 file family is `BITCODE_SPEC_V47.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V47_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V47_NOTES.md`,
`BITCODE_SPEC_V47_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and eventually
`BITCODE_SPEC_V47_PROVEN.md`. Promotion must be workflow-driven.

### Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operators need source-safe views of seller flow, buyer flow, measurements,
quotes, BTC-testnet observations, BTD rights, delivery, compensation, repair,
proof roots, and workflow receipts. Operator surfaces must remain measurable,
readable, accessible, performant, and repairable.

### Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

V47 keeps historical scenario coverage terms auth-issuer-rollback,
privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation,
auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch,
context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably
readable, Provable, and Valuable.

New V47 scenarios are IP seller deposits an AssetPack and IP buyer buys a
Need-Fit AssetPack on staging-testnet.

### Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

V47 fails closed on invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness,
parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial,
public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, stale promoted
status truth, measurement formula drift, BTC-testnet quote mismatch, and
repository delivery failure.

### Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing artifacts include `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`,
`.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`,
`.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`,
`.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and
`BITCODE_SPEC_V47_PROVEN.md`. Source-bearing payloads remain protected until
entitlement; source-safe receipts may be projected.

## V47 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

- V46 remains active canon until V47 promotion.
- V47 Gate 1 does not authorize runtime behavior changes.
- V47 testnet means BTC amounts are testnet only; system behavior remains
  production-intended.
- Measurement must be visible and source-safe before a user decides to deposit
  or buy.
- Conversation surfaces, ChatGPT App commercialization, MCP/API
  commercialization, deeper BTD mining cryptography, mainnet launch authority,
  and advanced market mechanics are deferred to later versions.
- Any source leakage, measurement ambiguity, quote/finality collapse, rights
  ambiguity, or delivery ambiguity reopens the relevant gate.

## V47 completion condition

V47 Gate 1 is complete when the V47 draft spec family exists over active V46,
testnet semantics and measurement law are specified, the seller/buyer launch
scope and ten-gate plan are recorded, the roadmap names V47 as active draft
target, `check:v47-gate1` exists, gate/canon workflows validate active V46 plus
draft V47, and the gate branch is committed, pushed, and pull-requested into
`version/v47`.

V47 Gate 2 is complete when launch-facing entrypoints resolve to `/deposit`,
`/read`, and `/packs`; old `/exchange` entrypoints are compatibility redirects
or rewritten into `/packs`; BTD acquisition and detail paths no longer send
users to `/terminal` or `/exchange`; `/terminal` and `/conversations` direct
entry are retained or flaggable rather than launch CTAs; API/MCP, ChatGPT App,
Bitcode Chat, value-bearing mainnet, source-bearing previews, and advanced
market mechanics are explicitly deferred; `.bitcode/v47-feature-excess-
alignment-audit.json` is generated; `check:v47-gate2` validates the audit; and
gate/canon workflows run the Gate 2 checker while V46 remains active canon.

V47 Gate 3 is complete when the IP seller state machine covers source
connection, deposit AssetPack option synthesis, source-safe measurement review,
Depository admission approval, and compensation/repair tracking; the IP buyer
state machine covers Read request, Need review, Finding Fits, source-safe
AssetPack preview, BTC-testnet settlement, BTD rights, and repository delivery;
the guards enforce measurement-before-price, proof-before-state, accepted Need
before Finding Fits, quote-before-settlement, BTC finality before BTD rights,
BTD rights before source delivery, `/packs` history projection, and
fail-closed repair; `.bitcode/v47-seller-buyer-state-machine-law.json` is
generated; `check:v47-gate3` validates the law; and gate/canon workflows run
the Gate 3 checker while V46 remains active canon.
