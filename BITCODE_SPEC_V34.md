# Bitcode Spec V34

## Status

- Version: `V34`
- V34 state: Gate 4 ledger/database/object-storage deployment posture is closed over promoted V33 canon
- Current canonical/latest target: `V33`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_PROVEN.md`

- Scope: V34 draft system specification for deployment depth over promoted Terminal, Reading, Protocol/BTD, Auxillaries, MCP API, ChatGPT App, public API, proof, and interface contracts
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V33`

V34 begins from promoted V33.
V33 closed commercial interface-depth across MCP API, ChatGPT App, public API, package-owned schemas, authorization policy, Read license and AssetPack rights contracts, compatibility matrices, telemetry/proof hooks, consumer UX proof, and promotion readiness.
V34 makes that commercial system operator-deployable: explicit host capabilities, environment lanes, distributed execution receipts, storage durability, deployment approvals, rollback, upgrade, secret rotation, data repair, and staging-testnet rehearsal become current-system law.

## Version executive summary

V34 is the deployment-depth version.
It turns the proven V33 commercial interface system into an operator-deployable system whose runtime conditions are as explicit as its Protocol/BTD and interface contracts.
Enterprise Bitcode operation must prove where the system is running, what capabilities are available, which lane admits which value posture, where durable state is stored, how long-running work is receipted, how migrations and promotions are approved, and how failures are repaired without leaking secrets, wallet material, protected source, or unpaid AssetPack contents.

V34 closes only when deployment operators and automated systems can:

- identify every required host capability for website, API, MCP, ChatGPT App, workers, observers, broadcasters, proof services, and repair jobs;
- prove which environment lane is running: local, regtest, signet, staging-testnet, public testnet, mainnet-ready dry run, or value-bearing mainnet;
- run distributed pipeline, ledger, wallet, settlement, storage, proof, and repair work with typed execution receipts and replayable roots;
- validate deployment approvals, migrations, generated artifacts, secrets, and rollback readiness before traffic or value-bearing activity is admitted;
- rehearse local and staging-testnet deployment closure without exposing protected source, credentials, wallet private material, or unpaid AssetPack contents.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode measures technical knowledge, finds deposits that fit reviewed Reads, synthesizes source-bearing AssetPacks, and settles read rights in BTC with BTD range and rights receipts.
The active V33 canon remains:

- Deposits supply source material to the Bitcode depository.
- A Read Request is synthesized into a reviewed ReadNeed by `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis`.
- `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` searches for plural threshold-passing fit deposits and synthesizes source-safe AssetPack preview records.
- Protected AssetPack source remains hidden before paid settlement.
- BTC is the fee asset and BTD range/read-license/right transfer is ledgerized.
- Paid settlement unlocks full AssetPack delivery, including pull-request delivery where applicable.

V34 does not redefine those laws.
V34 makes them deployable, observable, recoverable, and promotion-safe across concrete runtime lanes.

## V34 source-of-truth hierarchy

The V34 source-of-truth hierarchy is:

1. `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`, which remains `V33` until V34 promotion.
2. `BITCODE_SPEC_V34.md` during V34 drafting.
3. `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_NOTES.md`.
4. `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_DELTA.md`.
5. `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PARITY_MATRIX.md`.
6. generated V34 artifacts under `.bitcode/` when produced.
7. `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PROVEN.md` only after promotion.
8. source implementation, tests, examples, public docs, internal docs, and QA evidence that realize this family.

Older specifications are provenance only.
They must not become hidden current-system law.

## V34 full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V34 must be re-implementable and auditable from its specification family without reading conversation history.
Every host capability contract, environment lane, distributed runtime receipt, storage carrier, deployment approval, rollback plan, migration gate, secret rotation path, repair job, and promotion check must identify:

- canonical object;
- required inputs;
- outputs and stored artifacts;
- deterministic, inferred, external, or policy-derived fields;
- proof obligations;
- failure and repair posture;
- implementation and validation surfaces.

## V34 totality and precision enforcement rule

V34 fails closed when any deployable Bitcode surface lacks an explicit host capability, environment-lane posture, runtime receipt shape, storage durability posture, migration/approval gate, rollback path, secret boundary, and proof replay expectation.
Each gate must preserve exact abstraction names:

- executions are the base runtime records;
- pipelines compose phase-wise behavior;
- agents are PTRR agents;
- PTRR steps are the four formal agent steps;
- sub-steps are ThricifiedGenerations;
- pipeline inference points are ThricifiedGenerations;
- tools are registry-backed tool calls;
- prompts are prompt-part and prompt-template registry compositions;
- interfaces are contract consumers, not owners of protocol truth;
- deployment lanes are runtime postures, not source version names;
- deployment receipts are auditable runtime records, not dashboard-only assertions.

No source identifier may introduce a versioned route, gate, or work-in-progress name unless explicitly accepted as a bounded compatibility artifact.

## V34 system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- define a `DeploymentHostCapabilityCatalog` over website, API, MCP, ChatGPT App, workers, observers, broadcasters, proof services, and repair jobs;
- define an `EnvironmentLaneContract` over local, regtest, signet, staging-testnet, public testnet, mainnet-ready dry run, and value-bearing mainnet;
- define `DistributedExecutionRuntimeReceipt` records for long-running pipeline, ledger, wallet, proof, object-storage, and repair work;
- define `DeploymentStoragePosture` for ledger-derived state, canonical database projection, object storage, proof artifacts, audit logs, and rollback material;
- define `MigrationApprovalGate` and deployment CI/CD approvals for schema mutation, generated artifacts, promotion commits, Vercel/Supabase lanes, and secret availability;
- define `SecretRotationPlan`, `RollbackUpgradeRepairPlaybook`, `RuntimeObserverRepairJob`, and `DeploymentReadinessRehearsal`;
- rehearse local and staging-testnet deployment readiness before value-bearing mainnet can be considered.

Non-goals:

- no new BTD supply or tokenomics law;
- no rewrite of `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` or `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` product law;
- no Exchange market-depth implementation;
- no website Conversations product-depth implementation;
- no broad telemetry/documentation program breadth that belongs to V35;
- no value-bearing production-mainnet approval.

Design principles:

- deployment law before deployment convenience;
- lane posture before runtime execution;
- durable receipts before dashboard-only observability;
- migration approval before schema mutation;
- secret rotation before credential aging becomes operational risk;
- rollback and repair posture before traffic or value-bearing activity.

## V34 system architecture and layer boundaries

V34 preserves the V33 architecture and adds deployment-depth ownership:

- `packages/protocol` owns canon posture, spec-family checks, generated-proof helpers, promotion-governance helper APIs, and deployment proof helper APIs.
- `packages/btd` owns BTD range, read-license, rights transfer, wallet capability, fee posture, settlement, access policy, reconciliation primitives, and value-lane admission boundaries.
- `packages/api` owns JSON-safe reusable route contracts over package primitives and must expose deployment posture only through source-safe schemas.
- `packages/pipelines/asset-pack` owns Reading pipeline contracts and source-safe preview outputs; runtime hosts may execute pipelines but must not redefine them.
- `packages/executions-mcp` owns MCP server contracts and tool exposure; MCP deployment posture must derive from package-owned contracts.
- `packages/chatgptapp` owns ChatGPT App action contracts and source-safe response rendering.
- `uapi` owns commercial product routes and user interfaces, but not protocol truth or deployment law.
- `protocol-demonstration` remains a standalone minimal reference and proof witness outside the workspace import graph.
- deployment host services own runtime carriers, queues, observers, broadcasters, repair jobs, object storage, and environment variables, but only through V34 contracts.

Layer boundaries:

- Commercial interfaces may call commercial APIs and packages; they must not import demonstration runtime code.
- Deployment hosts may run pipelines, observers, broadcasters, and repair jobs; they must not create alternate Protocol/BTD or Reading law.
- Ledger records and journals are source-of-truth for settlement/finality; Supabase/PostgreSQL projections must not contradict them.
- Object storage carries source-bearing AssetPacks, proof bundles, generated artifacts, and rollback material only under explicit disclosure and retention policy.
- Source-safe previews may expose measurements, roots, score bands, policy ids, fee quote roots, settlement posture, and denial reasons; they may not expose protected source before payment.
- Interface responses may expose proof roots and repair instructions; they must not expose secrets, service-role keys, wallet private material, provider tokens, raw protected prompts, or pre-settlement AssetPack source.
- Value-bearing mainnet activity is blocked until a future canon admits it; V34 may define readiness and dry-run proof, not production value launch.

## V34 proof/test package API and inherited support canon

V34 treats package APIs as the source of deployment truth.
The formal package boundaries are:

- `@bitcode/protocol` owns active/draft canon posture, generated proof helpers, and V34 deployment check helpers.
- `@bitcode/btd` owns rights, range, fee, wallet, access, treasury, reconciliation, and value-lane admission primitives.
- `@bitcode/api` owns reusable JSON contracts for public API consumers and source-safe deployment posture.
- `@bitcode/pipeline-asset-pack` owns Reading pipeline contract surfaces and source-safe preview outputs.
- MCP and ChatGPT App packages consume those contracts rather than inventing protocol-local shapes.

The commercial protocol package owns the active/draft posture while V34 is in flight:

- `ACTIVE_CANON_VERSION = 'V33'`;
- `DRAFT_TARGET_VERSION = 'V34'`;
- spec-family, canonical-input, canon-posture-drift, and proven-generation helpers remain exported through the package index;
- package tests and V34 checks fail closed on direct demonstration-source imports.

Any deployment object used by more than one runtime lane must have a package-owned type, builder, parser, validator, source-safe fixture, example, compatibility row, replay command, and generated artifact before the gate that depends on it closes.

## V34 canonical domain model

V34 adds deployment-facing contract objects over V33 protocol truth:

- `DeploymentHostCapabilityCatalog`: host id, runtime surface, required packages, outbound network posture, secret requirements, storage carriers, observer/broadcaster capability, repair capability, proof output paths, and admission status.
- `EnvironmentLaneContract`: lane id, supported Bitcoin network posture, Supabase/Vercel project posture, value-bearing admission, data-retention policy, wallet policy, secret scope, and proof requirements.
- `DistributedExecutionRuntimeReceipt`: execution id, host id, lane id, work kind, command or pipeline id, start/finish timestamps, `routeHandlerBoundary`, input root, output root, log root, object-storage root, ledger/database projection roots, wallet operation root, proof root, PTRR agent fields, ThricifiedGeneration fields, tool id, and repair posture. Required work kinds are `pipeline_run`, `ptrr_agent`, `thricified_generation`, `tool_call`, `ledger_operation`, `wallet_operation`, `proof_generation`, `object_storage_write`, and `repair_job`; long-running work uses `request_response_not_required` rather than route-handler completion.
- `DeploymentStoragePosture`: ledger-derived state, canonical database projection, object storage, proof artifacts, audit logs, rollback material, retention class, encryption posture, and repair command.
- `MigrationApprovalGate`: migration id, schema diff root, generated type root, dry-run result, reviewer approval, rollback plan, and deployment lane admission.
- `SecretRotationPlan`: secret family, storage owner, rotation cadence, rotation command, blast-radius note, proof root, and leak-response path.
- `RuntimeObserverRepairJob`: observer id, broadcaster id, repair job id, trigger, allowed lane, proof root, and replay command.
- `RollbackUpgradeRepairPlaybook`: rollback id, upgrade id, repair id, state carriers, validation commands, operator approval, and fail-closed posture.
- `DeploymentReadinessRehearsal`: local rehearsal, staging-testnet rehearsal, proof bundle, source-safe screenshots or logs, and admission verdict.
- `DeploymentPromotionReadinessReport`: Gate 10 artifact tying all V34 deployment gates, generated proofs, workflows, and promotion commands together.

Inherited V33 objects remain active: `Deposit`, `ReadRequest`, `ReadNeed`, `FindingFitsResult`, `AssetPackPreview`, `SettlementUnlock`, `BtcFeeQuote`, `BtdAssetPackMintReceipt`, `BtdReadReceipt`, `BtdRightsTransferReceipt`, `SourceToSharesProof`, `TerminalTransaction`, `McpToolContract`, `ChatGptAppActionContract`, `PublicApiRouteContract`, and `InterfaceTelemetryProofHook`.

## V34 gate plan

V34 closes through ten gates:

1. **Gate 1: V34 Deployment Roadmap And Spec Opening** opens the V34 family over V33 canon, updates `SPECIFICATIONS_ROADMAP.md`, documents V33 active / V34 draft posture, and wires `check:v34-gate1`.
2. **Gate 2: Host Capability And Environment Lane Catalog** inventories runtime hosts, services, queues, observers, broadcasters, storage carriers, and lanes through `DeploymentHostCapabilityCatalog` and `EnvironmentLaneContract`. It is closed by `packages/btd/src/deployment-host-capability-catalog.ts`, `.bitcode/v34-deployment-host-capability-catalog.json`, `.bitcode/v34-environment-lane-contracts.json`, `packages/btd/__tests__/deployment-host-capability-catalog.test.ts`, and `pnpm run check:v34-gate2`.
3. **Gate 3: Distributed Execution Runtime Contracts** defines `DistributedExecutionRuntimeReceipt` for long-running pipeline, PTRR agent, ThricifiedGeneration, tool, ledger, wallet, proof, object-storage, and repair work. It is closed by `packages/pipeline-hosts/src/distributed-execution-runtime-receipt.ts`, `.bitcode/v34-distributed-execution-runtime-receipts.json`, `packages/pipeline-hosts/src/__tests__/distributed-execution-runtime-receipt.test.ts`, and `pnpm run check:v34-gate3`.
4. **Gate 4: Ledger Database Object Storage Deployment Posture** hardens ledger-derived state, database projection, object storage, generated proof artifacts, audit logs, backup, retention, and rollback material. It is closed by `packages/btd/src/deployment-storage-posture.ts`, `.bitcode/v34-deployment-storage-posture.json`, `packages/btd/__tests__/deployment-storage-posture.test.ts`, and `pnpm run check:v34-gate4`; source-bearing AssetPack storage remains locked before settlement.
5. **Gate 5: Secret Rotation And Credential Boundary Operations** defines secret families, storage owners, rotation commands, leak-response posture, CI masking, and runtime availability checks.
6. **Gate 6: Migration CI/CD Deployment Approval Gates** hardens schema migration approvals, generated type refresh, route scans, promotion commits, Vercel/Supabase lane checks, and deployment blockers.
7. **Gate 7: Runtime Observers Broadcasters Repair Jobs** makes settlement observers, ledger broadcasters, projection repair jobs, proof generators, and queue consumers explicit deployment jobs with receipts.
8. **Gate 8: Rollback Upgrade Data Repair Playbooks** defines operator playbooks for rollback, upgrade, state repair, object-storage repair, generated artifact repair, and incident recovery.
9. **Gate 9: Local Staging Testnet Deployment Rehearsal** proves local and staging-testnet deployment readiness using source-safe rehearsal logs, runtime receipts, and UI/API validation without value-bearing mainnet admission.
10. **Gate 10: V34 Promotion Readiness** generates V34 proof artifacts, promotion readiness, active V34 / draft V35 posture, and canonical promotion support.

## V34 whole Bitcode operator chain

The V34 operator chain keeps V33 behavior and adds deployable runtime receipts:

1. Depositor supplies source material.
2. Bitcode records source-safe deposit measurement and proof roots.
3. Deployment hosts prove lane posture through `EnvironmentLaneContract`.
4. Runtime hosts prove available capabilities through `DeploymentHostCapabilityCatalog`.
5. Reader requests a Read through Terminal, API, MCP API, or ChatGPT App.
6. `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` synthesizes a ReadNeed for review.
7. Reader approves or requests regeneration of the ReadNeed.
8. `ReadFitsFindingSynthesis` searches the depository for plural threshold-passing deposits.
9. Distributed execution records pipeline, tool, agent, and storage roots through `DistributedExecutionRuntimeReceipt`.
10. Bitcode synthesizes a source-safe AssetPack preview and fee quote.
11. Reader reviews measurements, fit quality, policy posture, fee, and rights preview without protected source leakage.
12. Reader settles BTC fee and receives the BTD read/right transfer.
13. Observers, broadcasters, repair jobs, and storage carriers reconcile settlement, finality, rights, delivery, and proof state.
14. Bitcode unlocks full AssetPack delivery and records synchronized ledger, database, object-storage, execution, and interface proof state.

## V34 generated canon

V34 generated canon includes specifying artifacts, deployment-depth gate artifacts, runtime receipt artifacts, storage posture artifacts, rehearsal artifacts, and the Gate 10 promotion readiness report.
Generated artifacts must be stable, source-safe, and explicitly tied to validation commands.

## V34 promotion readiness canon

V34 Gate 10 closes when `version/v34` can promote to active V34 without direct `main` writes.
The readiness report `.bitcode/v34-promotion-readiness-report.json` proves that all V34 deployment artifacts are present, source-safe, parseable, wired into gate checks, wired into promotion checks, generated proof appendix support, and workflow validation.
Promotion rewrites runtime posture from `V33` active / `V34` draft to `V34` active / `V35` draft and generates `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PROVEN.md`.

## V34 validation canon

Validation must include spec-family checks, canonical-input checks, canon-posture drift checks, V34 gate checks, package tests, deployment contract tests, runtime receipt checks, storage posture checks, and source-safe rehearsal checks.
Every gate must name the command that proves closure.

## V34 promotion canon

V34 promotion may occur only after all V34 gates are closed and `version/v34` is requested into `main`.
Promotion rewrites `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` from `V33` to `V34`, generates `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PROVEN.md`, records source-safe `.bitcode/v34-*` evidence, and prepares active V34 / draft V35 posture.

## V34 appendices and canonical supporting material

The appendices below are binding checklists for V34 draft work and later promotion.

## V34 accepted boundaries and reopen conditions

Accepted boundaries:

- V34 owns deployment-depth, host capability truth, environment lanes, runtime receipts, storage posture, approval gates, rollback, upgrade, secret rotation, repair jobs, staging-testnet rehearsal, and promotion readiness.
- V34 may add deployment-owned telemetry/proof hooks, but V35 owns broad documentation and observability programs.
- V34 keeps Exchange and website Conversations product depth deferred.
- V34 keeps production-mainnet value-bearing launch blocked unless a future canon explicitly admits it.

Reopen conditions:

- a deployment lane admits value-bearing mainnet without future-canon authorization;
- a runtime host runs a protected workflow without a host capability row, lane contract, or runtime receipt;
- a generated deployment proof artifact contains secrets, protected source, or stale proof roots;
- storage, ledger, database, object-storage, or execution receipts drift without repair posture.

## V34 completion condition

V34 is complete when all ten gates are closed, deployment host capability and environment lanes are package-owned and tested, distributed execution receipts record long-running Reading and settlement work, storage posture is durable and source-safe, secret rotation and migration approvals fail closed, observer/broadcaster/repair jobs are explicit, local and staging-testnet rehearsals pass, generated artifacts are stable, and promotion can safely make V34 the active canon.

## Appendix A. Canonical type and surface catalog

Primary V34 types: `DeploymentHostCapabilityCatalog`, `EnvironmentLaneContract`, `DistributedExecutionRuntimeReceipt`, `DeploymentStoragePosture`, `MigrationApprovalGate`, `SecretRotationPlan`, `RuntimeObserverRepairJob`, `RollbackUpgradeRepairPlaybook`, `DeploymentReadinessRehearsal`, and `DeploymentPromotionReadinessReport`.
Primary surfaces: website, API, MCP API, ChatGPT App, workers, observers, broadcasters, repair jobs, ledger projection, database projection, object-storage projection, and proof replay.

Gate 2 catalog rows are package-owned source-safe metadata.
Required host row ids are `website`, `api`, `mcp_api`, `chatgpt_app`, `pipeline_workers`, `runtime_observers`, `ledger_broadcasters`, `proof_services`, `repair_jobs`, `object_storage`, `database_projection`, and `ledger_projection`.
Required lane row ids are `local`, `regtest`, `signet`, `staging-testnet`, `public-testnet`, `mainnet-ready-dry-run`, and `value-bearing-mainnet`.
The `value-bearing-mainnet` lane is visible as `blocked_future_canon_required`; it admits no runtime hosts and carries `mainnet_value_blocked` wallet policy.
Each host row names owner package, runtime surface, runtime carrier, packages, network posture, secret family names without values, storage carrier, observer/broadcaster/repair capability, validation path, failure mode, repair posture, telemetry proof hook id, and deterministic proof root.
Each lane row names Bitcoin network posture, Supabase and Vercel project posture, value-bearing admission, retention, wallet policy, secret scope, proof requirements, admitted hosts, failure mode, repair posture, telemetry proof hook id, and deterministic proof root.

## Appendix B. Proof family closure catalog

Every V34 proof family is replayable from generated artifacts and source-safe fixtures.

## Appendix C. Generated artifact contract catalog

### Inherited V19 reproducible-canon artifacts

V34 preserves inherited generated appendix structure and source-safe generated artifact inventories.

### Inherited V20 operator-quality artifacts

V34 preserves operator-quality proof output expectations and extends them to deployment operations.

### Exact generated-artifact inventory matrix

| artifactPath | owner | sourceSafety | validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.bitcode/v34-spec-family-report.json` | protocol | source-safe | `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V34 --mode draft --current-target V33` |
| `.bitcode/v34-canonical-input-report.json` | protocol | source-safe | `node scripts/check-bitcode-canonical-inputs.mjs --current-target V33` |

### V34 specifying generated artifacts

Gate 1 requires `.bitcode/v34-spec-family-report.json` and `.bitcode/v34-canonical-input-report.json` to be declared.
Gate 2 requires `.bitcode/v34-deployment-host-capability-catalog.json` and `.bitcode/v34-environment-lane-contracts.json` to be generated, source-safe, deterministic, and checked by `pnpm run check:v34-gate2`.
Gate 3 requires `.bitcode/v34-distributed-execution-runtime-receipts.json` to be generated, source-safe, deterministic, and checked by `pnpm run check:v34-gate3`, with receipt coverage for `pipeline_run`, `ptrr_agent`, `thricified_generation`, `tool_call`, `ledger_operation`, `wallet_operation`, `proof_generation`, `object_storage_write`, and `repair_job`.
Later V34 gates introduce the remaining deployment artifacts listed above.

### Shared generated-artifact fields

Every V34 generated artifact carries artifact id, generatedAt, proof-source commit, active canon target, draft target, source safety class, validation command, and fail closed when the artifact is stale or source-unsafe.

### Artifact-specific generated payload fields

Deployment artifacts additionally carry host id, lane id, storage carrier, execution id, observer id, broadcaster id, repair id, migration id, secret family id, rollback id, and rehearsal id when applicable.

### Artifact confidentiality and disclosability taxonomy

Artifacts are public, internal, buyer-visible, reviewer-visible, or operator-only.
Public anchors must not leak non-disclosable artifacts, secrets, protected source, raw protected prompts, wallet private material, or service-role credentials.

### Minimum generated appendix rendered contents

The generated appendix must render aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when any artifact is missing or stale.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Canonical regeneration fails closed when generated inputs drift, source safety fails, required artifacts are absent, validation commands fail, or promotion posture is stale.

## Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

Gate 1 validation is `pnpm run check:v34-gate1`.
Gate 2 validation is `pnpm run check:v34-gate2`, with artifact freshness checked by `pnpm run check:v34-host-capability-environment-lanes` and focused package coverage in `packages/btd/__tests__/deployment-host-capability-catalog.test.ts`.
Gate 3 validation is `pnpm run check:v34-gate3`, with artifact freshness checked by `pnpm run check:v34-distributed-execution-runtime-receipts` and focused package coverage in `packages/pipeline-hosts/src/__tests__/distributed-execution-runtime-receipt.test.ts`.
The gate-quality workflow also runs spec-family, canonical-input, canon-posture drift, and diff hygiene checks.
Later gates add generated artifact checks close to their deployment contract surfaces.

## Appendix E. Current canonical source map

- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to active V33 during V34 drafting.
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V33.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V33_PROVEN.md` are the prior canonical anchor and proof appendix.
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V34.md`, notes, delta, and parity are the draft family.
- `packages/protocol/src/canon-posture.js`, `protocol-demonstration/src/canon-posture.js`, and `packages/protocol/data/state.json` carry V33 active / V34 draft posture.
- `_legacy/` is historical only.

## Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

Every V34 deployment object must derive from source, spec, generated artifact, test, and replay command.
No host/runtime capability truth, operator experience and pedagogy, validation and test stack, generated artifacts and canonical promotion, or telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics row may be asserted by prose alone.

## Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

The V34 file family is `BITCODE_SPEC_V34.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and eventually `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PROVEN.md`.
Promotion rewrites `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` only after promotion-grade validations pass on `version/v34`.

## Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces include GitHub workflows, local scripts, Vercel deployments, Supabase lanes, object-storage carriers, CLI proof commands, Terminal runtime views, MCP API actions, ChatGPT App actions, and public API routes.
Quality contracts require greenable CI, deterministic generated artifacts, readable repair posture, source-safe logs, and no direct `main` pushes.

## Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

Required cross-product scenarios remain active for auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch, context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, and Valuable.
V34 adds deployment rehearsal scenarios that prove local, staging-testnet, public testnet, mainnet-ready dry run, and blocked value-bearing mainnet posture.

## Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

V34 preserves existing fail-closed causes: invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, and stale promoted status truth.
V34 adds deployment-specific causes: missing host capability, missing environment lane, missing runtime receipt, stale secret, migration approval denial, object-storage drift, observer drift, broadcaster drift, rollback gap, rehearsal failure, and value-bearing mainnet blocked.

## Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing AssetPack artifacts remain governed by `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V34_PROVEN.md`.
V34 adds deployment storage posture and runtime receipt proof around those artifacts; it does not make protected source visible before settlement.
