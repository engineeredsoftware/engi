V28 begins from the promoted V27 tokenomics and cryptographic-commercial implementation.
V28 does not reopen `$BTD` supply law, measureminting law, BTC fee separation, AssetPack range identity, access-right separation, or V27 crypto receipt invariants.

V28 exists to make those laws usable through the commercial Protocol implementation and Terminal.
The Terminal remains the primary operator chain, and V28 hardens Protocol packages, UAPI protocol routes, Auxillaries readiness, BTD range disclosure, wallet/BTC/testnet posture, MCP API, and ChatGPT App into a coherent MVP experience.
Exchange and the website Conversations interface are intentionally outside V28 closure.

## V28 Purpose

V27 made `$BTD` exact.
V28 makes the commercial Protocol implementation and Terminal experience exact enough for MVP QA.

The central V28 product and protocol question is:

> Can an operator use Bitcode's commercial Protocol implementation and Terminal to move through readiness, Auxillaries setup, Deposit, Read/Fit work, synthetic measurement, BTD-AssetPack minting, BTC fee/testnet authorization, ledgerized journaling, `$BTD` range disclosure, licensed-read state, journal diffing, and reconciliation without relying on demonstration code or reading package internals?

V28 answers that by specifying:

- commercial Protocol and Terminal QA across Terminal, Auxillaries, BTD range disclosure, MCP API, ChatGPT App, auth/readiness, wallet/BTC/testnet flows, and route navigation;
- removal of Exchange and website Conversations from V28 acceptance criteria, navigation expectations, and QA closure;
- Auxillaries contained tabs-left cleanup, removing old orbital layout conflicts from the active auth/profile/readiness experience;
- Terminal wallet connection and signer-session review over V27 wallet primitives;
- BTC fee preparation, PSBT handoff, signature status, broadcast status, confirmation/replacement/reorg readout, and failure recovery;
- Read submission and Fit closure with visible source roots, proof roots, semantic volume, measuremint entitlement, zero-cell/refit posture, and access-policy binding;
- Terminal AssetPack range details derived from the registry, not aggregate compatibility balances;
- owner-read and licensed-read state visible from policy and registry evidence;
- Terminal journal rows and ledger/database reconciliation repairs as ordinary operator-readable transaction details;
- organization holdings, read-license usage, role posture, MCP authorization, and ChatGPT App action authorization as registry-derived facts;
- testnet and signet operational readiness surfaces that expose V27 telemetry and deployment-lane receipts;
- realistic testnet BTD-AssetPack minting, synthetic measurement journaling, ledger anchors, and wallet/BTC receipt paths before any value-bearing mainnet posture;
- Taproot-first Bitcoin anchoring posture, with BSC/opBNB/Binance Web3 Wallet work recorded as research-informed future bridge/distribution planning rather than V28 issuance law;
- honest provider readiness where GitHub is the implemented VCS provider and broader provider rollout is later external-connection work;
- V28 promotion proof after implementation, tests, builds, and route scans close.

## V28 Terminal Terminology Contract

V28 user-facing Terminal language is Deposit/Depositing and Read/Reading.
Pre-V28 Terminal vocabulary is retired from operator-visible copy, QA instructions, public docs, Terminal labels, tooltip prose, test-visible assertions, staging walkthroughs, and active data-contract carriers.

Deposit means source supply is selected, bound to a repository/branch/commit, signed where required, and submitted as the candidate supply side before any meaningful Read/Fit result is evaluated.
Read means the demand/query/measurement side that reads against available deposited source posture, then proceeds into Fit, proofs, finalities, ledgerization, and reconciliation.

As of the V28 Deposit/Read data-contract closure, active database, ORM, API, QA-query, OpenAPI, demonstration, and protocol carriers use Deposit/Read naming where they are part of the current contract.
Remaining strings containing `deposit`, `read`, or `read-measurement` are current V28 names, not compatibility vocabulary.
The live staging migration may use bounded dynamic compatibility references only to upgrade already-deployed data without keeping retired identifiers in the active schema.

## Real-Deployed Staging-Testnet MVP Target

V28 closure is now judged primarily by one real staging-testnet operator path with mocks disabled.
Mock mode remains a deterministic regression harness, but manual acceptance must prove that the deployed staging-testnet application is honest and minimally usable from first onboarding through Terminal Deposit and Read results.

The V28 staging-testnet target path is:

1. Open `/terminal` with Exchange and website Conversations disabled and with public mock flags off.
2. Open the Wallet auxillary pane and connect a Bitcoin-capable browser wallet on the configured testnet lane.
3. Capture a signed Bitcoin identity proof, bind payment/auth address facts, and project the wallet session into Supabase through Bitcode's custom Bitcoin-auth boundary.
4. Return to top chrome and verify that wallet identity, BTC fee posture, and BTD posture replace anonymous `Connect Wallet` state only after wallet status is known.
5. Open Externals and install or connect the GitHub App so repository inventory and source scope are available for Deposit and Read.
6. Keep Profile limited to optional email/contact/admin posture; email may improve notifications, but it is not the primary identity primitive.
7. In Terminal, perform the simplest Deposit path against a GitHub repository/source scope, binding repository, branch, commit, signer, and selected source supply before any Read/Fit result is evaluated.
8. Select or express the simplest Read against the deposited source posture, produce Fit-finding evidence, show review/proof/dedupe roots, and read the Fit result without leaving Terminal.
9. Synthesize the resulting AssetPack through protocol-specified model and pipeline configuration, not user-selected ledgerized synthesis preferences.
10. Emit or simulate the BTC fee/testnet ledger path with user-controlled signing, explicit blocked-readiness receipts when broadcast is unavailable, and no server custody.
11. Record synthetic measurement, measuremint result, AssetPack range or zero-cell receipt, access-policy hash, ledger anchor or ledger-observed placeholder, Terminal journal entry, and database projection.
12. Reconcile ledger/journal/database state and expose any drift as a blocking or repairable Terminal read while reading earning, settlement, or blocked-readiness state from the same Terminal/protocol readback grammar.

V28 does not require value-bearing mainnet behavior.
Regtest, signet, public testnet, and staging-testnet readiness may be used, but value-bearing mainnet requires a separate approval root.
Ledgers and ledgerized journals remain source-of-truth for cryptographic finality; Supabase/PostgreSQL is the ledger-derived and Bitcode-canonical data realm for private/metaphysical facts, projections, readiness, and UI read models.

MCP API and ChatGPT App MVP entrypoints must read from the same wallet, GitHub, Terminal journal, AssetPack, access-policy, and proof state.
They may trigger admitted actions only through the same fail-closed Protocol boundary that Terminal uses.

## Deterministic Model Posture

User-driven model selection is not allowed for ledgerized Bitcode synthesis.
Fit-finding, AssetPack synthesis, semantic measurement, measureminting, proof admission, ledgerized journaling, and settlement must use protocol-specified model identities, model versions, prompts, thresholds, toolchains, and receipt-bound configuration.

This rule exists because user-selected model preferences would break replay, parity, and settlement determinism.
Changing a ledgerized model or pipeline configuration is a protocol/specification event with receipt/proof impact, not a per-user setting.

Allowed exception:

- non-ledgerized conversational interfaces may expose user model selection for draft conversation UX;
- any output that becomes Fit evidence, AssetPack material, measurement, proof, journal, or settlement input must pass through the protocol-specified ledgerized path and record the model/configuration roots used.

Active source or UI that presents broad "apply model to all" behavior for Terminal, Protocol, Fit, AssetPack, or BTD synthesis is V28 legacy residue.
It must be removed, hidden behind a conversation-only boundary, or made explicitly non-ledgerized before V28 promotion.

## Commercial Application MVP QA Scope

The screenshot QA finding from May 6, 2026 shows that Auxillaries still mixes the older orbital visual shell with the newer contained tabs-left approach.
That is V28 work.
It is not a future Auxillaries feature, because it breaks the current commercial MVP experience.

V28 therefore owns:

- removal or containment of old orbital background/layout styles where they conflict with the active Auxillaries tabs-left experience;
- auth modal sizing, empty-state, and content-position QA;
- route-level QA for `/`, `/terminal`, `/auxillaries/*`, `/btd/[assetPackId]`, MCP API routes, ChatGPT App entrypoints, and current protocol routes, with Exchange and website Conversations hidden or disabled for V28 QA and the prior generic workspace route absent from active source;
- visual, responsive, and interaction QA for commercially active surfaces;
- Terminal operator-readiness preparation on top of V27 primitives;
- package/UAPI commercialization of protocol and demonstration-derived primitives so commercial code does not import runtime implementation from `protocol-demonstration/`.

Later versions may deepen individual products:

- V29: deeper Terminal workflows and transaction operation.
- V30: reserved for post-V29 Protocol/BTD hardening discovered during V28/V29, not Exchange.
- V31: deeper Auxillaries.
- V32: deeper provation and testing.
- V33: deeper Interfaces beyond the V28 MVP, while V28 retains MCP API and ChatGPT App MVP acceptance.
- V34: deeper Deployment, including host capabilities, real executions, distributed compute, runtime/storage expectations, and canonical-promotion CI/CD.
- V35: deeper telemetry and documenting across internal codebase docs plus public `/docs` usage material.
- V36+: deeper Exchange and website Conversations work after V35.

## Version Boundaries

V28 owns commercial Protocol implementation MVP QA, Terminal MVP hardening, Auxillaries readiness cleanup, MCP API/ChatGPT App MVP, and Terminal-operated crypto-readiness preparation.

V28 requires:

- active canon remains V27 until V28 promotion;
- V28 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY exist before implementation gates close;
- Terminal, Auxillaries, BTD disclosure, MCP API, and ChatGPT App surfaces read from V27 package/API/database primitives rather than redefining tokenomics;
- active commercial surfaces meet MVP layout, copy, responsiveness, auth, and navigation QA;
- Auxillaries uses the contained tabs-left approach without old orbital shell collision in the active experience;
- wallet, BTC fee, AssetPack range, read-license, journal, reconciliation, telemetry, and upgrade state are surfaced in Terminal product language;
- compatibility storage carriers are hidden behind Bitcode vocabulary and registry-derived read models;
- no new versioned UAPI route family is introduced;
- implementation source remains implicitly versioned to the active canon and current gate: routes, file names, CSS, constants, tests, and identifiers must not introduce explicit version/gate/work-in-progress names without a bounded compatibility instruction;
- repository contribution flow uses a V28 version branch as the draft integration
  branch, with scoped gate-number-prefixed branches opened from it and
  pull-requested back into it only when their gate acceptance criteria are
  implemented, specified, tested, documented, and ready for closure review;
- value-bearing mainnet remains gated by explicit operational approval;
- V29 Terminal depth, V30 Protocol/BTD hardening, V31 Auxillaries depth, V32 provation/testing depth, V33 interface depth beyond the V28 MVP, V34 deployment depth, V35 telemetry/documenting depth, and V36+ Exchange/Conversations depth remain staged unless V28 requires a narrow Protocol/Terminal/MCP/ChatGPT hook.

V28 does not require:

- Exchange route, Exchange master-detail, order-book, buy/sell/bid/ask, wrapper liquidity, or website Conversations MVP closure;
- third-party market routing;
- completion of Bitbucket, GitLab, Azure DevOps, generic Git, or webhook provider families;
- final legal review for every future license template;
- value-bearing mainnet launch;
- a new `$BTD` supply law.

## Inherited V27 Laws

The following V27 laws are inherited unchanged:

```text
BTD_MAX_MINTABLE_SUPPLY = 21_000_000

One $BTD = one unique non-fungible source-share cell.
One AssetPack = one contiguous range of $BTD cells.
Only proof-backed Read-Fit settlement can mint $BTD.
BTC is the fee asset.
$BTD is not a spend token.
Measureminting decays toward the fixed supply ceiling.
Zero-cell/refit receipts are valid tail receipts.
Ancestry is optional, late-bound, evidence-based, and non-supply.
Ledger facts govern cryptographic finality.
Database projections must not contradict ledger and journal truth.
```

V28 may improve how these laws are read and operated.
V28 may not quietly redefine them.

## External Chain Research Interpretation

V28 incorporates the BitVM, Taproot, BNB Chain, Binance, and BTD compatibility research as planning guidance, not as a new issuance law.

V28 therefore treats:

- Bitcoin Taproot, BIP340 Schnorr signatures, BIP341 Taproot outputs, BIP342 tapscript, PSBT, and wallet-controlled signing as the primary Bitcoin-side primitives to test and expose.
- BitVM and BitVM2/BitVM3 as Bitcoin/Taproot-compatible bridge research, not production dependencies for V28.
- BSC, opBNB, BEP-20, Binance Web3 Wallet, Binance dApp self-listing, and Binance listing paths as future bridge/distribution pilots, not current `$BTD` chain-of-record truth.
- BNB-side compatibility as bridge-mediated because BNB Chain is EVM-compatible rather than a native Taproot or BitVM execution environment.
- native BSC/opBNB BTD testnet pilots as possible V30+ or V36+ research outputs only after V28 proves Bitcoin-side wallet, BTC fee, synthetic measurement, BTD-AssetPack minting, ledgerized journal, and database projection behavior.

Any V28 UI or document that mentions BNB Chain, Binance, BSC, opBNB, BitVM, or BEP-20 must label that posture as future bridge/distribution research unless an explicit testnet artifact exists and is bound to the V28 proof record.

## Terminal Transaction Path

The V28 Terminal must present the Bitcode transaction path as a single operator flow:

```text
Readiness
  -> Read submission
  -> Read measurement
  -> Read review
  -> Fit review
  -> proof and dedupe
  -> measuremint entitlement
  -> access policy binding
  -> BTC fee preparation and wallet authorization
  -> AssetPack synthesis and range projection
  -> ledger anchor or ledger observation
  -> journal entry
  -> reconciliation read
  -> protocol readback
```

Each step must expose enough state for a competent operator to know:

- what is being requested;
- what evidence was used;
- which root or receipt proves it;
- which readiness condition is missing when blocked;
- whether wallet authorization is user-controlled;
- whether BTC or `$BTD` is involved;
- whether the operator has owner-read, licensed-read, or no read right;
- whether ledger/database state agrees;
- and what repair, retry, or review action is available.

## Terminal Read Models

V28 Terminal read models must be registry-derived.

Required read models:

- `TerminalWalletReadiness`: wallet provider, address, network, signer-session state, authorization proof kind, expiry, and fail-closed reason.
- `TerminalBtcFeeReadiness`: fee purpose, sats, PSBT or unsigned transaction handoff state, txid, finality state, confirmations, replacement/reorg/failure reason.
- `TerminalReadFitRead`: Read id, source scope, semantic-volume receipt, Read review decision, Fit review qualities, proof root, dedupe root, settlement journal root.
- `TerminalMeasuremintRead`: cumulative measurement before/after, target minted before/after, residual credit, token count, zero-cell reason, range projection if minted.
- `TerminalAssetPackRangeRead`: AssetPack id, range start/end, cells summary, owner, policy id/hash, source manifest root, proof root, ledger anchor state.
- `TerminalReadRightRead`: owner-read, licensed-read, denied reason, license scope, expiry, policy hash, derivative and redistribution flags when policy-bound.
- `TerminalJournalDiffRead`: local intent, settlement sequence, ledger observation, database projection, drift kind, blocking status, and repair receipt root.
- `TerminalOrganizationBtdRead`: organization holdings, team role, licensed-read usage, treasury route state, and registry-derived permission result.
- `TerminalOperationalHealthRead`: lane, network, broadcaster/observer state, telemetry severity, approval root, rollback root, and upgrade posture.

These read models may be implemented incrementally.
They must remain adapters over V27 primitives rather than new tokenomics sources of truth.

## Gate Milestones

### Gate 1: Draft Opening And Promotion Review

Purpose:
Open V28 from V27 canon and convert the V28 notes into SPEC, DELTA, and PARITY documents.

Acceptance criteria:

- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` still points to `V27`.
- `protocol-demonstration/src/canon-posture.js` reports V27 active canon and V28 draft target.
- V28 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY files exist.
- V26/V27 promotion-tail findings are classified as V28 inputs or later-version deferrals.
- active UAPI API route scan shows no versioned route family.
- no V28 generated proof appendix is claimed before promotion.

### Gate 2: Commercial Application MVP QA Baseline

Purpose:
Make active Protocol/Terminal surfaces visually coherent, navigable, and MVP-readable before deeper Terminal work.

Acceptance criteria:

- Auxillaries active auth/profile/readiness experience uses the contained tabs-left model without old orbital layout collision.
- sign-in, sign-up, signed-in, and signed-out Auxillaries states are responsive and not pushed offscreen.
- Auxillaries portal entry, including unauthenticated `Connect Wallet`, opens the contained Auxillaries shell rather than the old onboarding/orbital shell.
- mock and testnet-readiness Auxillaries entry render the same pane order and shell regardless of caller; V28 primary onboarding order is Bitcoin wallet identity first, GitHub repository connection second, optional email notifications third.
- Bitcoin wallet authentication must use a Bitcoin-capable wallet provider, with Xverse/Sats Connect first, Leather direct-provider second, UniSat/OKX fallback, and manual Bitcoin-address staging only when no Bitcoin dapp provider is discoverable. When multiple providers are detected, Wallet must expose provider-specific actions such as `Connect Xverse` and `Connect Leather` so a stalled Xverse prompt does not block Leather verification. The flow must obtain a Bitcode Bitcoin authentication proof when available, bind the Bitcoin address to the wallet identity/profile projection, preserve payment/auth address distinction, and persist wallet-provider connection posture without server custody of private keys.
- non-mock/staging QA must fail clearly when the Bitcoin wallet provider is unavailable, the browser exposes only an Ethereum provider, Supabase session persistence is unavailable, signed proof capture fails, or the connection-storage migration has not been applied; local staging may preserve the wallet identity for QA continuity while backend persistence is repaired.
- Auxillaries selector cards use centered pane names plus visual state indicators, not duplicate lane-title prose, and hover movement must not clip the first selector card.
- Auxillaries profile panes must be scrollable on first render, including unauthenticated and non-mock contained portal entry.
- Auxillaries settings panes auto-save edits; visible pane-level Save buttons are not part of the commercial MVP shell.
- the Wallet auxillary shows BTD as the primary large balance, shows owned AssetPack count and BTC wallet liquidity as secondary stats, moves explanatory system copy into tooltips/accessibility labels, avoids long-identifier overflow, and includes a Protocol/Terminal activity table for BTD-relevant owned packs, Deposits, Reads, proof closures, ledger anchors, synthetic measurements, and range-bearing activity.
- notification dropdowns remain legible and do not include redundant Auxillaries footer launchers when top chrome and profile menu already provide that entry.
- route QA covers `/`, `/terminal`, `/auxillaries/*`, `/btd/[assetPackId]`, MCP API routes, ChatGPT App entrypoints, and protocol routes; Exchange and website Conversations are disabled or hidden for V28 QA, and the prior generic workspace route is verified absent from active source.
- Exchange navigation is disabled for V28 and must not be required by any V28 acceptance criterion; any retained Exchange route/API behavior is treated as deferred compatibility or future work.
- V28 QA lanes set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_EXCHANGE_LINK=true`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_EXCHANGE_ROUTE=true`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERSATIONS_WIDGET=false`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_CONVERSATIONS_ROUTE=true`.
- signed-in navigation shows BTC and BTD balances as peer wallet facts, without `$BTD` currency-token styling, with a distinct visual separator, and with hover context reserved for recent BTD AssetPacks rather than explanatory product copy.
- connected-wallet navigation is driven by wallet identity, not only by email/Supabase user state; a locally staged Bitcoin provider connection must replace anonymous `Connect Wallet` chrome with BTC/BTD posture while backend persistence is still pending.
- Externals visibility is driven by wallet identity or an existing user session; once Wallet has staged a Bitcoin wallet, Externals must render GitHub connection controls even when optional email/Supabase session persistence is still pending.
- top-right BTD hover action shows the connected wallet nickname when available and otherwise shows the middle-truncated Bitcoin address; clicking it opens the Wallet auxillary pane rather than treating the balance widget as an Exchange shortcut.
- Wallet owns Bitcoin wallet identity, robust wallet-provider readout, BTC fee posture, and BTD share/range posture; Externals owns GitHub connection and future VCS/provider attachments; Profile owns optional email/contact/admin posture.
- Leather support is a first-class V28 Bitcoin wallet path. The implementation must detect `window.LeatherProvider.request`, call `getAddresses` without index-based assumptions, prefer Taproot `p2tr` for Bitcode auth when present, retain Native SegWit `p2wpkh` as the payment address, derive the account number from the returned derivation path when available, sign the Bitcode challenge with `signMessage` using explicit `paymentType` and network, and expose tested utilities for `open`, `sendTransfer`, and hex `signPsbt` so Terminal BTC fee/PSBT work can depend on the same wallet contract.
- Leather's documented Bitcoin network parameter uses `testnet`, not `testnet4`; V28 may run a Testnet4-facing staging lane, but the Leather provider call must use the provider-supported value until Leather exposes a different documented enum.
- V28 verbose QA telemetry may log wallet detection, wallet signing, local/server persistence, user-data merge, nav identity state, and BTD wallet pane entry behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_BITCODE_QA_VERBOSE=true`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BITCODE_VERBOSE=true`, `?bitcode_verbose=true`, or `localStorage.bitcode.qa.verbose=true`.
- automated Playwright E2E coverage exists at commercial-product granularity for public home, Terminal, Auxillaries, BTD range disclosure, MCP API/ChatGPT App readiness, docs, route navigation, responsive route health, and key micro-interactions including URL-addressable Terminal activity filters, filter reset behavior, BTD data-share consent, and public docs article readability.
- Playwright tests must check browser console/page-error cleanliness, framework-overlay absence, route readability, micro-interface interaction, and stitched user flows rather than only screenshot snapshots.
- the commercial-MVP Playwright runner executes serially against one deterministic mock-mode dev server, including mocked Auxillaries profile, non-ledgerized interface preferences, data-share, notifications, Terminal activity, BTD mint/read state, and MCP/ChatGPT App readiness paths, so failures represent product regressions rather than local wallet/session availability.
- visual QA proves no framework overlay, blank page, major content overlap, or unreadable primary controls.

### Gate 3: Terminal Wallet, BTC Fee, And Read-Fit-Measuremint Workflow

Purpose:
Make user-controlled signing, BTC fee state, V27 measurement, and mint-admission law visible before the operator commits.

Acceptance criteria:

- Terminal exposes wallet connection, network, signer-session state, proof kind, and expiry.
- Terminal blocks signed settlement when wallet authorization is missing, expired, revoked, or wrong-network.
- Terminal exposes BTC fee prepared, signed, broadcast, confirmed, replaced, reorged, and failed states.
- PSBT or wallet-native unsigned handoff is visible where applicable.
- `$BTD` is never displayed as fee liquidity.
- Read measurement evidence and review decision are visible before Fit review.
- Fit review displays qualities and roots needed for settlement review.
- semantic volume, cumulative measurement, measuremint target, residual credit, token count, zero-cell reason, and refit posture are visible.
- source deposit, Read discovery, preliminary Fit, and uncommitted proof never imply minting.
- access policy id/hash is shown before mint or licensed-read commitment.
- ledgerized synthesis uses protocol-specified models and configuration; Terminal must not expose user-driven model selection for Fit, AssetPack, measurement, measuremint, proof, journal, or settlement behavior.
- gate pull requests into `version/v28` run maintained gate-quality automation
  covering draft-canon checks, casing/import checks, package typechecks,
  package tests, protocol-demonstration QA, and diff hygiene.
- repository-wide canon-quality automation stays greenable during the V28 draft
  by checking V27 canonical inputs, V27/V28 posture, V28 draft-family shape,
  and V28 MVP demonstration QA; full promoted-suite closure is reserved for
  the V28 promotion workflow.
- application CI uses root pnpm workspace installation and maintains required
  uapi lint, typecheck, production build, and mocked Jest coverage checks;
  full DB/browser E2E, Storybook build, super-linter, and advanced CodeQL are
  explicit variable-enabled validations until their catalogs are maintained
  enough to be promoted into always-on branch protection.
- the legacy GA1 workflow is removed; version-specific quality and promotion
  workflows own V28 gate and promotion automation.

#### Single-deposit Reading QA

The first value-producing V28 Read/Fit QA scenario runs against the
smallest real Bitcode data-space: one deposited repository revision.
The current staging fixture happens to use `engineeredsoftware/ENGI`, but
Terminal implementation must remain repository-, owner-, branch-, and
commit-generic.

The required Read is not "does anything exist?".
It is:

> Read the deposited repository revision and determine whether it contains
> a worthy, proof-bearing path for Bitcode Terminal's wallet/GitHub readiness,
> Deposit, Read/Fit, AssetPack evidence, settlement/finality readback, and
> Supabase/ledger reconciliation flow. If the evidence is worthy, synthesize
> the minimal AssetPack; if not, return explicit no-worthy-fit or blocked
> readiness evidence.

Acceptance criteria:

- the Read cannot run until a Deposit row exists for the selected repository
  with repository, branch, commit, signer, and wallet authorization posture;
- the Read and Fit rows must carry the same repository, branch, and commit as
  the deposited source revision;
- Finding Fits discovery must prefer source and proof surfaces that explain the
  product-critical path, including Terminal Deposit/Read components, execution
  history persistence, repository source selection, wallet/GitHub readiness,
  QA SQL, and BTD/ledger proof readback;
- depository search must be a reusable AssetPack primitive, not a UI-only
  posture: every pipeline run stores searched asset count, query root, ranking
  root, fit deposit ids, rejected/blocker reasons, proof/measurement
  posture, embedding policy, and result state under the execution evidence
  tree;
- risk-admission and readiness agents have an evidence-only verification tool,
  `bitcode.asset-pack.verification`, that reads back the current depository
  search result or reruns search from pipeline input, then returns bounded
  proof, measurement, readback, source-binding, fit-deposit, blocker,
  warning, query-root, ranking-root, and embedding-policy evidence. The tool
  must not mutate state, deliver assets, mint, settle, or expose private
  AssetPack source before settlement;
- Fit evidence must include a compact selection trace for operator review:
  selected, blocked, and ranked candidates; source binding; use tier; score
  channels; selected unit hashes; proof/measurement evidence; provider recall;
  blockers; warnings; and rejection reasons. The full depository search result
  can retain candidate payloads, but the Fit result must expose this bounded
  trace directly for Terminal, SQL, and harness summaries.
- vector recall for deposited AssetPack evidence uses OpenAI
  `text-embedding-3-small` by default with `encoding_format='float'` and
  `dimensions=1536`, matching Supabase `deliverable_vectors.embedding
  vector(1536)`, `ivfflat`, `vector_cosine_ops`, and
  `match_deliverable_vectors` cosine readback. Any model or dimension override
  creates a distinct vector space and must not mix with existing rows unless the
  rows are re-embedded and the matching function/schema still agree;
- the Fit result must expose ranking quality, rejection reasons, proof roots,
  dedupe/materialization roots where available, and finality/readiness status;
- AssetPack synthesis must be protocol-specified and reproducibly evidenced;
  deterministic bring-up branches are regression scaffolds, while
  staging-testnet QA must run model-backed PTRR inference. If source
  materialization, settlement, BTC fee broadcast, ledger anchor, or BTD range
  issuance is not live, the result must state that blocker rather than imply
  delivery or minting;
- negative controls must return no-worthy-fit or clarification, not a decorative
  AssetPack, when the Read is unrelated to ENGI's deposited source or too broad
  to measure;
- SQL readback must show Deposit before Read, Read before Fit, no
  `frontier/*` or mock repository leakage, and no ledger/database drift for any
  finality that Terminal claims.
- Readback for a gate-closing run must be coherent to the latest deliverable
  run, not only aggregate row counts inside a lookback window. A failed latest
  run, missing latest-run tool rows, or cross-run-only telemetry must keep the
  gate blocked until a fresh complete run writes its own phase, agent,
  generation, tool, and settlement evidence.
- Ledger settlement evidence must carry neutral protocol fields:
  `settlementAdmissible`, `ownershipBoundary`, `btcFee`, and `readback`.
  Depositor ownership, reader fee/license posture, and server-custody state
  must be explicit even when settlement is blocked.

#### Pipeline host runtime environment for Read/Fit QA

V28 now admits a lightweight deployment harness because the first value-bearing
Read/Fit result cannot be reviewed from local posture rows alone.
The harness is not the full V34 distributed deployment program; it is the
minimum real host contract needed to prove that AssetPack pipeline run,
agent/prompt/tool context, artifact export, and telemetry readback are running
before Terminal may classify a Read as `worthy_fit` or `no_worthy_fit`.

The V28 QA host is Vercel Sandbox.
The active host capability contract is:

- isolated Firecracker microVM execution on Amazon Linux 2023;
- default working directory `/vercel/sandbox`;
- stable documented runtimes `node26`, `node24`, `node22`, and `python3.13`,
  with `node24` as the default Bitcode harness runtime;
- `vercel-sandbox` user with sudo available for setup;
- ephemeral filesystem, requiring evidence export before sandbox stop;
- command execution, command log collection, file upload/download, exposed
  ports when explicitly requested, snapshots, and egress network policies;
- authentication through Vercel OIDC tokens from a linked project or through
  explicit access-token variables for non-Vercel environments.

The V28 pipeline harness must write a manifest before execution containing:

- Read id and Read text;
- Deposit id and optional deposited AssetPack id;
- Deposit proof root, measurement root, and reconciliation readback root.
  When a recorded Deposit activity already asserts wallet/attestation proof
  and asset measurement posture but has not stored root fields, the harness
  must materialize deterministic manifest-bound roots from the Deposit id,
  AssetPack id, Read id, repository, branch, and commit. These roots are
  admissible as harness evidence roots for Finding Fits discovery and Fit review;
  they are not external finality claims and still require SQL/ledger readback
  before settlement.
- repository full name, branch, and commit;
- host capability summary;
- expected stages: deposit search, fit deposit ranking, Read comprehension,
  AssetPack synthesis, validation, Finish, and telemetry readback;
- expected SQL evidence surfaces: `executions`, `execution_events`,
  `pipeline_runs`, `run_jobs`, `stream_logs`, `phase_executions`,
  `deliverable_pipeline_runs`, `deliverable_pipeline_events`,
  `deliverable_pipeline_phase_delegations`, `deliverable_pipeline_agent_steps`,
  `deliverable_pipeline_generations`, and `deliverable_pipeline_tool_executions`;
- PTRR agent executions must resolve the evidence tools registered by their
  parent pipeline run. A requested evidence tool must either execute and
  persist tool telemetry or fail as typed blocked-readiness evidence; missing
  registry linkage is not admissible live-pipeline behavior. Artifact stream
  events must carry the tool name, input/output/error presence, and ok/error
  state so Terminal and SQL readback show which evidence tool ran.
- admissible result states `worthy_fit`, `no_worthy_fit`, and
  `blocked_readiness`;
- redacted command-environment names only, never secret values.
- optional QA-only source overlay metadata when a local patch is applied before
  dependency installation. Overlay evidence is not source-revision proof and
  cannot support settlement or finality.

The harness has two admissible modes:

- `host_smoke`: proves Vercel Sandbox creation, command execution, artifact
  export, and stop/cleanup. This mode always produces `blocked_readiness`
  because it does not invoke the AssetPack pipeline.
- `asset_pack_pipeline`: clones or mounts the selected repository revision,
  installs workspace dependencies, builds the manifest Deposit into searchable
  depository supply, invokes the AssetPack pipeline entrypoint, exports
  evidence and telemetry artifacts, and relies on SQL readback before any
  result is accepted.

If a local source overlay is used to debug the harness before deployment, the
run must report `sourceOverlay.admissibility` as
`qa-only-not-source-revision-evidence` and fail closed for
settlement review even when the pipeline output itself contains a worthy
classification. The same implementation must exist at the deposited source
revision before that result can become source-bound evidence.

Read/Fit result review remains fail-closed:

- `worthy_fit` requires source-bound pipeline output plus event, phase, agent,
  generation/tool, proof/readiness, and ledger/database readback evidence.
- `no_worthy_fit` requires source-bound rejection reasons from the pipeline,
  not absence of UI posture alone.
- `blocked_readiness` is mandatory when source materialization, model/tool
  credentials, telemetry persistence, BTC fee, ledger anchor, settlement,
  AssetPack range projection, or finality readback is unavailable.
- staging-testnet Read/Fit QA must run model-backed inference.
  `BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE=1` is the deployment-level switch for the
  AssetPack pipeline. Deployed route-streaming runs should use
  `BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE_PROFILE=bounded`: setup, synthesis,
  validation, and Finish stay model-backed while deterministic source-bound
  depository discovery preserves enough route budget to synthesize, ship, and
  read back the AssetPack. `BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE_PROFILE=full`
  is reserved for the later long-running async completion gate described below;
  the current deployed Terminal route must reject it until sandbox completion
  pushes finished state to a server-side stream/socket handler. A run with
  omitted per-agent `*_USE_PTRR` flags is not an acceptable staging posture
  unless the global real-inference flag and explicit profile are present.
- manifest-only Deposit supply can satisfy Finding Fits discovery but cannot produce
  `worthy_fit` unless proof and measurement posture are explicitly visible to
  the pipeline input and the downstream readback queries confirm them. Boolean
  wallet/measurement posture must be converted into deterministic
  manifest-bound proof, measurement, and reconciliation roots before Fit
  evaluation; if that conversion cannot be made, the run must return explicit
  `blocked_readiness`. Manifest-bound roots support Read/Fit selection but do
  not claim BTC fee broadcast, BTD minting, or external ledger finality.
- every SDIVF phase, PTRR agent step, ThricifiedGeneration, and tool execution
  must be inspectable as prompt/context input, raw model/tool output,
  parsed/typed output, usage/timing metadata, and phase/agent/step/failsafe
  correlation. A harness failure must still export the execution tree so
  operators can debug the last successful sub-execution.
- tool telemetry includes both direct `tool-use` emissions and stored
  `tools/*` status results from pipeline delivery work. Depository search,
  evidence verification, branch creation, file write, and pull-request creation
  must appear in the generic event stream and, when database streaming is
  enabled, in `deliverable_pipeline_tool_executions` with sanitized input,
  output, error, and phase/agent/step correlation.
- artifact telemetry must subscribe to stream events even when database
  streaming is disabled; database persistence is an additional acceptance gate,
  not the only way to inspect a live failed run.
- the deployed Terminal harness stream must expose sandbox id, run id, and
  incremental telemetry artifact lines while the detached sandbox command is
  still running. Browser-only Network inspection is not sufficient; the
  operator-visible stream must show phase, agent, generation/tool, parsed
  output, and failsafe context as first-class Read/Fit run evidence. Terminal
  must render these events through the canonical Bitcode execution stream panel
  shape so Read/Fit live runs are visually consistent with persisted execution
  activity and retain expandable raw metadata per line.
- the harness must enforce an internal runtime budget before the caller's host
  timeout, producing a `blocked_readiness` artifact rather than allowing the
  host to terminate without evidence.
- secrets for wallets, GitHub, model providers, Supabase service roles, or
  other systems may be passed into a sandbox only by explicit allowlist or
  brokered network policy; routine QA artifacts must show only redacted names.
- pull-request delivery should normally use the reader's authenticated GitHub
  App connection. For trusted local/staging harness QA, an operator token may be
  supplied only by setting `BITCODE_VCS_ALLOW_ENV_TOKEN_FALLBACK=1` and
  explicitly forwarding `GITHUB_TOKEN` through the sandbox allowlist; VCS tools
  must read that token from process environment without placing it in tool
  inputs, artifact telemetry, or database stream rows.
- `BITCODE_LLM_PROVIDER` and `BITCODE_LLM_MODEL` may pin the model path for
  reproducible generation; otherwise the runtime selects the available provider
  from credential posture, with OpenAI accepted when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is the
  only model credential present. A provider pin without a matching forwarded
  credential is not an admissible reason to require that provider.
- the deployed staging trigger may use Vercel's automatic Sandbox OIDC, but it
  still needs a server-side model credential such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, real
  Supabase admin/service-role credentials for telemetry persistence, and a
  runtime budget that is shorter than the enclosing Vercel Function window.
- Supabase and Vercel deployments are lane-specific. V28 Read/Fit gate evidence
  is staged against the staging-testnet Supabase project
  `tkpyosihuouusyaxtbau`, whose Data API origin is
  `https://tkpyosihuouusyaxtbau.supabase.co/rest/v1/` and whose DB readback host
  is `db.tkpyosihuouusyaxtbau.supabase.co`. The production-mainnet Supabase
  project is a separate lane and must not satisfy staging-testnet readback,
  telemetry, settlement, or preview-deployment acceptance.
- Vercel preview deployments must be branch-scoped to the staging-testnet lane:
  staging previews use the staging-testnet Supabase Data API/admin keys, DB URL,
  model credentials, and Sandbox auth; production deployments use the
  production-mainnet Supabase project. A preview deployment that combines
  staging DB readback with production-mainnet REST keys is invalid even when
  one side can read rows.
- a local application deployment may stand in for route/UI implementation QA
  when live deployment is explicitly out of scope. In that mode the operator
  must run the Terminal application locally with
  `BITCODE_PIPELINE_HARNESS_REQUIRE_REAL_INFERENCE=1`,
  `BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE=1`,
  `BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE_PROFILE=bounded`, aligned Supabase
  admin credentials, OpenAI credentials, and Vercel Sandbox local auth.
  `SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_DB_URL` /
  `DATABASE_URL`, when both are present, must resolve to the same Supabase
  project, and anon JWTs must not satisfy admin-key preflight. Mixed REST/DB
  project refs are a fail-closed condition because they make telemetry and
  ledger settlement readback non-comparable. Local UAPI runs may load a
  branch-scoped root env file through `BITCODE_UAPI_ENV_FILE` so placeholder
  package-local env files do not override the accepted lane.
  Local application deployment evidence can prove route preflight, canonical
  stream rendering, artifact streaming, and SQL readback behavior, but it
  cannot close a live source-revision settlement/finality gate unless the same
  source and database/ledger rows are read back from the accepted environment.

### Gate 4: Enterprise Reading Pipelines And Settlement UX

Purpose:
Finish the enterprise Reading product experience around two named pipelines
and five reviewable Terminal steps. `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` turns a
reader's Read Request into a measured Need that the reader can review.
`ReadFindingFitsSynthesis` accepts only that reviewed Need, searches the Bitcode
Depository for every qualifying fit deposit above the configured confidence and
quality thresholds, synthesizes a source-safe AssetPack from those deposits
when enough fit evidence exists, and prepares BTC settlement and pull-request
delivery evidence.

Acceptance criteria:

- Terminal separates exactly five enterprise Reading user steps: request Read,
  review synthesized Need, request Fit, review synthesized AssetPack, and buy
  AssetPack/settle.
- `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` owns request normalization, Need
  comprehension, Need measurement, and operator review. All phase ids, agent
  ids, PTRR step ids, ThricifiedGeneration ids, prompt ids, and telemetry ids are prefixed under
  `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis`.
- `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis` owns accepted-Need admission, setup/read
  comprehension, depository discovery, vector/lexical Finding Fits search,
  AssetPack implementation from qualifying fit deposits, validation,
  source-safe preview, Share-to-Fee pricing, settlement readback, and
  pull-request delivery. All phase ids, agent ids, PTRR step ids,
  ThricifiedGeneration ids, tool ids, prompt ids, and telemetry ids are prefixed under
  `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis`.
- the Read-Need comprehension pipeline stores prompt templates, prompt inputs,
  interpolated context, raw model responses when used, parsed typed Need,
  measurement root, review state, feedback history, resynthesis attempts, and
  acceptance roots.
- Read-Need synthesis tests cover typed Need construction, measurement roots,
  source constraints, pricing measurement vectors, review-state transitions,
  feedback/resynthesis telemetry, and route responses that expose prompt input,
  prompt templates, interpolated context, raw output posture, parsed typed
  output, and next action.
- the Finding Fits pipeline accepts only reviewed Read-Needs, searches
  deposited supply, ranks source-bound deposit fits, admits every qualifying
  fit deposit above the configured thresholds, synthesizes the AssetPack from
  those fit deposits, and emits fit/no-fit/blocked evidence with fit deposit
  ids, score, proof, measurement, readback, and rejection telemetry.
- Finding Fits tests cover strict accepted-Need admission, depository search,
  vector/embedding search RPC shape, fit deposit ranking, source-bound proof
  and measurement blockers, `worthy_fit`, `no_worthy_fit`, and
  `blocked_readiness` branches, source-safe preview, Share-to-Fee quote, range
  projection, settlement boundary, and pull-request delivery target posture.
- Every Reading pipeline phase must declare its phase, agent, PTRR step,
  ThricifiedGeneration ids, prompt template, interpolated prompt/context input,
  tool input, tool output, raw model response, parsed typed output,
  timing/usage, and fail-closed state in telemetry. Until a phase is fully
  live, tests must require valid typed mocks for the same
  phase/agent/tool/PTRR/ThricifiedGeneration envelopes so mock mode cannot
  drift from the live contract.
- AssetPack preview exposes measurements, score posture, fit rationale, fit
  deposit ids, roots, fee quote, range projection, and disclosure policy
  without exposing protected source or source-bearing patches before
  settlement.
- Share-to-Fee calculation is implemented as an auditable structured policy:
  measurement weights, measurement volumes, admitted fit quality, floor/dust
  rules, BTC network fee posture, and final quote roots are stored and tested.
- settlement requires reader BTC payment authorization and readback of fee,
  BTD ownership/license transfer to the paying reader, journal, anchor, range,
  and database projection rows before unlock.
- Terminal exposes AssetPack id, range boundaries, cell count, proof root,
  source manifest root, access policy id/hash, ledger anchor state, and the
  pull-request delivery target after settlement.
- owner-read, licensed-read, pending-settlement, and denied branches are
  distinct.
- aggregate compatibility balances are not treated as canonical ownership truth.
- route and UI labels describe AssetPack ranges and read rights, not fungible balances.

### Gate 5: Terminal Journal Diff And Reconciliation

Purpose:
Make ledger/database drift visible and repairable without raw JSON inspection.

Acceptance criteria:

- Terminal transaction detail reads Terminal journal entries.
- ledger observed facts, database projected facts, and metaphysical canonical facts are separated.
- confirmed, reorged, and failed ledger facts block contradictory projections.
- repair receipts and blocking drift reasons are visible.
- operator can distinguish retryable, repairable, and approval-required states.

Implementation posture:

- `/api/executions/history/[runId]` must return the selected execution with
  Terminal journal readback, related BTC fee row, ledger anchor row,
  AssetPack range row, ownership/license projection rows, recent
  reconciliation repair receipts, and readback errors as typed detail payload
  fields rather than requiring browser-network raw JSON inspection.
- Terminal detail owns a Journal section that separates ledger observed facts,
  database projected facts, and metaphysical canonical root facts. The visual
  surface must preserve the raw payload accordion for audit while making the
  operator state readable at a glance.
- Confirmed, reorged, and failed finality observations are blocking facts for
  contradictory projections. Reorged/failed observations block unlock;
  confirmed observations that contradict missing projections require explicit
  approval or repair rather than silent retry.
- Retryable means expected rows or readback are not visible yet without a
  final blocking observation. Repairable means reconciliation receipts or drift
  evidence can be applied without override. Approval-required means a
  confirmed ledger observation contradicts the projected database state.

### Gate 6: Terminal Organization And Access Policy

Purpose:
Make team, organization, MCP, ChatGPT App, and read-license decisions registry-derived.

Acceptance criteria:

- organization holdings and read-license usage read from registry/range/license state.
- MCP-triggered and ChatGPT App-triggered actions use owner-read or licensed-read checks rather than aggregate holding gates.
- policy templates cover owner-read, licensed-read, derivative use, redistribution, confidentiality, dispute, and takedown posture.
- Terminal copy avoids price-appreciation, dividend, copyright-transfer, or marketplace-royalty promises.

Implementation posture:

- Organization `$BTD` posture is a registry projection. Read models must collect member wallet bindings, then read ownership events and read-license rows from the BTD registry. Aggregate compatibility balances may remain contextual but must not admit organization, MCP, ChatGPT App, or read-license actions.
- MCP admission may require current owner-read or licensed-read evidence for one or more AssetPacks. Deprecated aggregate holding gates must fail closed and point callers to registry-derived read-access requirements.
- ChatGPT App write-capable connected-interface tools must require explicit user confirmation and typed read-access evidence carrying AssetPack id, wallet id, owner-read or licensed-read decision, policy hash, and reason.
- Access-policy templates must remain source-readable and test-covered for owner-read, licensed-read, derivative use, redistribution, confidentiality, dispute, and takedown posture.
- Active Terminal and Auxillaries copy must describe registry, range, ownership, license, and proof posture without implying price appreciation, dividends, copyright transfer, or marketplace royalties.

### Gate 7: Terminal Operations And Testnet Readiness

Purpose:
Make V27 deployment lanes and crypto telemetry operable from Terminal.

Acceptance criteria:

- local, regtest, signet, public testnet, mainnet-ready, and mainnet-value-bearing lanes are displayed with correct approval posture.
- value-bearing mainnet requires approval root.
- broadcaster/observer health and telemetry severity are visible.
- upgrade, rollback, migration, and generated-type refresh state is visible where applicable.
- GitHub-only VCS readiness is honest; broader provider work remains outside V28 MVP QA unless required by the active surface.
- realistic testnet BTD-AssetPack minting uses synthetic measurement receipts, Terminal journal rows, ledger anchors or ledger-observed placeholders, and database projections that can be diffed and repaired.
- Bitcoin Taproot/PSBT posture is first-class; BSC/opBNB/Binance Web3 Wallet pilots remain future bridge/distribution work unless they are represented as disabled readiness or documentation notes.
- the next-gate Reading test contract is green and treated as acceptance
  evidence: package Read-Need tests, depository-search tests, embedding/vector
  search tests, Vercel Sandbox harness plan/host tests, pipeline-harness
  route/preflight tests, Terminal stream adapter tests, and demonstration
  local-fit tests all pass and remain mapped to this SPEC.
- bounded-real-inference readiness is tested separately from deterministic
  mock posture. Mocked phase/agent/tool/ThricifiedGeneration outputs are admitted only when
  they satisfy the same typed envelope, telemetry, and fail-closed contracts as
  the live Reading pipelines.

Implementation evidence:

- `packages/btd/src/terminal-operational-health.ts` is the canonical package
  adapter for Terminal operational health. It builds the displayed lane,
  telemetry, upgrade, provider, settlement-network, synthetic testnet minting,
  Terminal journal, ledger anchor, and ledger/database reconciliation read
  from BTD primitives rather than a UI-only fixture.
- `uapi/app/terminal/TerminalOperationalHealthPanel.tsx` renders that package
  read in Terminal. It keeps all six lanes visible, blocks value-bearing
  mainnet without an operational approval root, exposes broadcaster/observer
  severity, displays rollback/migration/generated-type refresh posture, shows
  GitHub as the active VCS path, and marks BSC/opBNB/Binance Web3 Wallet pilots
  disabled.
- Gate 7 implementation tests are
  `packages/btd/__tests__/terminal-operational-health.test.ts` and
  `uapi/tests/terminalOperationalHealthPanel.test.tsx`; package-level BTD tests
  are runnable through `pnpm -C packages/btd test`.

### Gate 8: V28 Promotion Proof

Purpose:
Promote V28 only after commercial Protocol/Terminal MVP QA, Terminal readiness productization, MCP/ChatGPT App MVP readiness, tests, proof, and documentation are closed.

Acceptance criteria:

- V28 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, PARITY, and PROVEN are synchronized.
- package/API, ORM, protocol-demonstration, UAPI route, Terminal UI, and build checks pass.
- unversioned-route scan passes.
- V29 Terminal depth, V30 Protocol/BTD hardening, V31 Auxillaries depth, V32 provation/testing depth, V33 interface depth beyond the V28 MVP, V34 deployment depth, V35 telemetry/documenting depth, and V36+ Exchange/Conversations depth are explicitly staged.
- a V28 version-branch pull request into `main` runs promotion-grade
  automation; only after those validations pass does automation commit the
  standalone `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` pointer change.
- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` remains V27 until the final automated promotion step.

## Draft Boundary

This V28 SPEC is draft-target material.
It is not promoted canon until V28 gates close and `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` is explicitly promoted from `V27` to `V28`.

## Version executive summary

V28 is the commercial Protocol implementation and Terminal MVP QA/hardening version for the promoted V27 `$BTD` and crypto rails.
The version makes Terminal, Auxillaries, BTD disclosure, MCP API, ChatGPT App, auth/readiness, wallet/BTC/testnet flows, and route navigation commercially coherent while turning registry, wallet, BTC fee, AssetPack range, access, journal, reconciliation, telemetry, and upgrade primitives into operator-readable workflows.
Exchange and website Conversations are not part of V28 closure.

## Canonical Bitcode executive summary

Bitcode remains a proof-bearing technical knowledge exchange.
V28 keeps V27 tokenomics canon intact while making the commercial Protocol implementation coherent enough for source-to-shares work, with Terminal as the primary operator surface.

## source-of-truth hierarchy

The hierarchy is:

1. `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` points to the active canon, currently `V27`.
2. `BITCODE_SPEC_V27.md` and `BITCODE_SPEC_V27_PROVEN.md` are the active promoted law and proof appendix.
3. `BITCODE_SPEC_V28.md`, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY are draft-target material.
4. V27 package/API/database primitives are source-bearing implementation truth.
5. Terminal UI and route reads must adapt those primitives without redefining them.

## full-system, re-implementation, and audit rule

V28 implementation must audit the whole Terminal path before claiming closure.
Re-implementation is allowed only when it removes compatibility confusion or exposes V27 truth more directly.
No `_legacy/` source is active source truth.

## totality and precision enforcement rule

Every Terminal claim about wallet state, BTC fees, `$BTD`, AssetPack ranges, licensed reads, journal finality, or reconciliation must point to a package primitive, API route, database projection, receipt, ledger fact, or proof artifact.
If that pointer is missing, Terminal must block, label the missing readiness condition, or show the state as unproved.

## system goals, non-goals, and design principles

Goals:

- Terminal makes V27 crypto rails usable.
- operator reads are registry-derived.
- readiness failures are explicit and recoverable.
- proofs and receipts remain inspectable without raw JSON dependence.

Non-goals:

- no Exchange route/product closure;
- no website Conversations interface closure;
- no external-provider completion beyond honest readiness disclosure;
- no value-bearing mainnet launch;
- no new `$BTD` supply law.

Design principles:

- preserve V27 laws;
- prefer exact read models over marketing copy;
- fail closed on wallet, fee, ledger, policy, or projection drift;
- stage later-version work explicitly.

## system architecture and layer boundaries

V28 keeps these layer boundaries:

- `packages/btd`: protocol primitives and receipt constructors.
- `packages/api`: service-owned admission and route builders.
- `packages/orm` plus migrations: registry and projection persistence.
- `uapi/app/api`: unversioned Next route wrappers.
- `/terminal` plus `uapi/app/terminal`: Terminal route surface.
- `uapi/app/terminal`: Terminal implementation module retained as an internal component boundary while the prior generic workspace route remains absent.
- `uapi/app/btd/[assetPackId]`: AssetPack range disclosure surface.
- MCP API and ChatGPT App: V28 MVP interface surfaces over registry-derived policy and proof truth.
- `protocol-demonstration`: minimal deterministic protocol witness. It may
  contain a local source-bound fit-finding loop for E2E proof, but
  it must not import workspace packages or be imported by product runtime
  code.

## canonical domain model

The V28 domain model is:

- Read: measured demand reviewed before Fit.
- Fit: accepted source-to-Read match with reviewable quality.
- AssetPack: source-bearing output and commercial registry range object.
- `$BTD` cell: non-fungible source-share/read-right registry cell.
- AssetPack range: contiguous commercial transfer object.
- BTC fee transaction: fee receipt and ledger-observed payment state.
- Terminal journal entry: operator transaction event with settlement sequence.
- reconciliation repair: proof of ledger/database drift handling.
- access policy: owner-read, licensed-read, denial, derivative, redistribution, confidentiality, dispute, and takedown rule binding.

## whole Bitcode operator chain

The V28 operator chain is Readiness -> Read -> Fit -> Proof -> Measuremint -> Fee -> Anchor -> Range -> Read -> Journal -> Reconcile -> Protocol readback.
Every link must make proof or readiness state visible.

## staged Reading acceptance path

V28 separates Reading into distinct reviewable stages so readers can decide
whether Bitcode understood the need before Bitcode exposes or settles
source-bearing AssetPack material.

The Terminal enterprise Reading path is exactly five user steps:

1. **Request Read.** The enterprise reader supplies the repository/source
   scope and exact request. Bitcode records the source revision, target
   artifact kinds, closure criteria, and failure modes as
   `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.request` input.
2. **Review synthesized Need.** `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` synthesizes a
   measured `bitcode.read.need` with requirements, closure criteria, failure
   modes, target artifact kinds, source constraints, proof/settlement
   expectations, pricing measurement inputs, prompt telemetry, and feedback
   history. Terminal shows the full Need; the user can accept it or request
   resynthesis with feedback. No depository search, BTC fee, BTD mint, or
   AssetPack source disclosure is allowed before Need acceptance.
3. **Request Fit.** `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis` accepts only the latest accepted
   Need. The pipeline verifies Need schema/review/measurement roots, prepares
   setup and read-comprehension context, then the discovery phase searches the
   Depository through lexical and vector channels, admits every deposit whose
   source-bound score, confidence, proof, measurement, and readback posture are
   above the configured thresholds, ranks those fits, and returns
   `worthy_fit`, `no_worthy_fit`, or `blocked_readiness`.
4. **Review synthesized AssetPack.** When a worthy fit exists,
   `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis` implementation uses the discovered fit deposits
   as contextual knowledge to synthesize a source-safe AssetPack preview for
   the accepted Need. Preview may show Need measurement, Fit measurement, fit
   deposit ids, roots, score bands, proof posture, ownership boundary,
   settlement boundary, and price; it must not show protected source material
   or source-bearing patch contents before payment/right settlement.
5. **Buy AssetPack, settle.** Settlement records the reader BTC fee, mints or
   assigns the BTD range according to the standing supply law, transfers or
   licenses the BTD rights to the reader who paid for the AssetPack, writes
   ownership and read-license rows, anchors/journals the event, verifies
   database/ledger readback, and only then unlocks and delivers the full
   source-bearing AssetPack as a pull request to the reading repository.

The reader question therefore splits into two explicit operator questions:

- Does Bitcode understand the Read's Need?
- Did Bitcode find and synthesize a match good enough to preview confidently
  and pay for in BTC without source-IP leakage?

These five steps are separately addressable in Terminal and separately journaled in
the database/ledger readback. A Need stage run cannot be reused as a Fit result
unless the accepted Need id, Need measurement root, user review state, feedback
history, and synthesis telemetry are present. A Finding Fits run cannot be
promoted unless the input Need id and accepted Need measurement root match the
latest accepted Need revision. Preview cannot unlock source-bearing payloads.
Settlement cannot proceed unless the previewed AssetPack id, fee quote, BTD
range projection, wallet authorization, BTC fee transaction, ownership boundary,
journal entry, and ledger/database readback all agree.

The product pipeline now carries a typed `bitcode.read.need` object before
Finding Fits search. The Need object contains `needId`, `measurementRoot`,
requirements, closure criteria, failure modes, target artifact kinds, source
constraints, proof expectations, pricing measurement inputs, review state, and
feedback history. Strict Finding Fits run is admitted only when
`acceptedReadNeed` is present and has `reviewState='accepted'`; otherwise the
pipeline returns `blocked_readiness` before depository discovery. The
Vercel Sandbox harness synthesizes and accepts a Need before invoking the
bounded source-bound AssetPack pipeline so the closed staging-testnet evidence
path remains runnable while Terminal moves to the separate user review step.
`BITCODE_PIPELINE_REQUIRE_ACCEPTED_READ_NEED=1` or request-level
`requireAcceptedReadNeed=true` activates the strict boundary for API and route
callers.

The protocol demonstration carries only the minimal deterministic witness of
this path: local Need synthesis, explicit Need acceptance, local Finding Fits
ranking over fixture deposits, source-safe preview, and deterministic fee-quote
shape. It must remain self-contained and must not import the product pipeline,
registry, prompt, agent, Vercel, Supabase, UAPI, or package implementations.
Product code may compare against the witness, but it must own its own runtime
implementation.

### Reading pipeline contract inventory

`packages/pipelines/asset-pack/src/reading-pipeline-contract.ts` is the
source-owned inventory for V28 Reading pipeline names, prompt/agent/tool
contracts, PTRR step ids, ThricifiedGeneration ids, return types, telemetry
fields, and proof counts.
Specification, Terminal UX, API route telemetry, and tests must stay aligned to
that inventory.

`ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` has four phases, four PTRR agents, sixteen
declared PTRR steps, forty-eight ThricifiedGeneration units, four
model-structured PTRR steps, and no tools:

| Phase | PTRR agent | Agent objective | Return type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.request` | `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.request.normalize` | normalize source context: extract read prompt, bind source revision, normalize target artifact kinds | `ReadNeedSourceInput` |
| `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.comprehend` | `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.comprehend.need-synthesizer` | synthesize Need: classify intent, bound requirements, bound non-goals, derive closure | `ReadNeed` |
| `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.measure` | `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.measure.need-measurement` | weighted requested volume: semantic relevance, source binding, artifact fit, closure specificity | `ReadNeedPricingMeasurementInputs` |
| `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.review` | `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.review.operator-review` | accept or resynthesize: render full Need, record feedback, accept Need, compute acceptance root | `AcceptedReadNeed` or `ResynthesisRequestedReadNeed` |

Every PTRR agent above owns exactly four PTRR steps: `plan`, `try`, `refine`,
and `retry`. Every PTRR step owns three ThricifiedGeneration units for
`prepare-concise-context`, `chunk-then-sum`, and `stitch-until-complete`; each
ThricifiedGeneration is the strict reason, judge, structured-output sequence.

`ReadFindingFitsSynthesis` has seven phases, eight PTRR agents, thirty-two
declared PTRR steps, ninety-six ThricifiedGeneration units, sixteen
model-structured PTRR steps, and four tool contracts:

| Phase | PTRR agent | Agent objective | Return type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.admit` | `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.admit.accepted-need-gate` | verify accepted Need: schema, review state, measurement root | `ReadFindingFitsAdmission` |
| `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.prepare` | `ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.prepare.setup-plan` | setup plan: summarize Read, source revision, fit boundaries | `PlanSchema` |

The required tool contracts are
`ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.tool.lexical-depository-search`,
`ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.tool.vector-depository-search`,
`ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.tool.verification-evidence`, and
`ReadFindingFitsSynthesis.tool.vcs-create-pull-request`. Every inference telemetry
line must expose prompt template, interpolated prompt/messages, raw response,
parsed typed output, schema/return type, usage/timing, execution state, and
fail-closed status. Every tool telemetry line must expose tool id, input
posture, output posture, error posture, result state, and execution state.
The contract encodes `ptrrStepId` as `<PipelineName>.<phase>.<agent>.<plan|try|refine|retry>`,
`thricifiedGenerationIds` as
`<PipelineName>.thricified-generation.<phase>.<agent>.<plan|try|refine|retry>.<failsafe>`,
reason/judge/structured-output prompt ids under
`<PipelineName>.prompt.<phase>.<agent>.<plan|try|refine|retry>.<failsafe>.*`,
and telemetry ids as `<PipelineName>.telemetry.<field>`, so tests can reject
generic or ambiguous phase evidence before promotion.

Prompt and return-type audit:

| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis` | 1 | 4 | `ReadNeedComprehensionSynthesis.prompt.need-synthesis` | `ReadNeed` |

Every model-structured PTRR step records the common prompt registry posture:
`factoryAgentWithPTRR` with the `prompt` + `stepPrompts` carrier, agent
prompt id, PTRR step prompt id, prompt template id, interpolated context, raw
response, parsed typed output, and the ThricifiedGeneration reason, judge, and
structured-output prompt ids for all three failsafe contexts.

### Share-to-Fee measurement clarity

V28 keeps the standing supply law intact while sharpening the initial
deterministic pricing/readiness interface. The initial Share-to-Fee calculation
must be deterministic from recorded measurements:

- each Need measurement vector dimension has a volume and a measurement weight;
- each fit deposit measurement vector is evaluated against the accepted Need
  measurement vector;
- the priced measurement volume is the weighted admitted volume after fit,
  quality, proof, and settlement eligibility gates;
- the initial deterministic shape is
  `sum(measurement_weight * measurement_volume * admitted_fit_quality)` before
  applying the configured BTC fee schedule;
- BTC price is derived from that priced measurement volume by the configured
  staging-testnet fee schedule and recorded as a reader fee quote;
- the quote is previewable before payment, but source contents and licensed
  read rights are not unlocked until settlement readback succeeds.

This pricing path is a V28 product acceptance target, but it must remain
fail-closed: if the Need measurement, Fit measurement, fee schedule, wallet
authorization, BTC fee, BTD range, or ledger readback is missing, the Terminal
shows blocked readiness rather than implying settlement.

Gate 4 implementation state:

- `/api/read-review` exposes server-side Read-Need synthesis, resynthesis, and
  acceptance actions while preserving the prior Read review boundary. The
  response stores prompt input, interpolated source context, parsed Need,
  measurement root, review state, feedback, and synthesis telemetry.
- Read-Need test coverage must stay implementation-guiding rather than
  snapshot-only: it must assert typed Need fields, measurement roots,
  source-disclosure constraints, pricing measurement vectors, acceptance
  roots, feedback/resynthesis handling, route telemetry shape, and the rule
  that raw Read requests cannot directly enter strict Finding Fits run.
- Terminal live Finding Fits run requires an accepted `bitcode.read.need`
  object in addition to Deposit and admitted-Read activity ids. The live
  harness request carries `acceptedReadNeed` and
  `requireAcceptedReadNeed=true`, so depository discovery cannot run
  from a raw Read request.
- The AssetPack pipeline package owns the source-safe preview contract:
  preview id, AssetPack id, Need root, Fit roots, fit deposit ids, score
  band, disclosure policy, access policy id/hash, deterministic Share-to-Fee
  quote root, BTD range projection, settlement boundary, and locked/unlocked
  read-right state.
- Finding Fits test coverage must assert depository search semantics before
  synthesis: embedding policy, vector dimensions, search RPC, source-bound
  fit deposit normalization, proof/measurement/readback blockers, mock/frontier
  leakage rejection, worthy/no-worthy/blocked result states, selection trace,
  and Execution-store persistence of search and fit evidence.
- The Vercel Sandbox harness writes that source-safe preview into the exported
  evidence artifact before ledger settlement readback. Terminal can stream the
  preview, fee quote, range projection, access state, ledger state, and
  pull-request target without exposing protected source before settlement.
- Harness and Terminal tests must assert the implementation envelope for the
  live path: sandbox plan generation, detached sandbox command polling, artifact
  readback, real-inference preflight, Supabase REST/DB lane matching, secret
  redaction, accepted-Need forwarding, rich stream summarization, generation
  and tool telemetry, and canonical stream-panel adaptation.
- The protocol-demonstration local loop remains the minimal independent
  witness. Its tests must cover local Need synthesis, explicit Need acceptance,
  accepted Finding Fits ranking, source-safe preview, deterministic fee quote,
  no-worthy-fit, and blocked-readiness proof failures without importing product
  packages or service adapters.

Gate 7 Reading pipeline coverage contract:

- The next gate cannot close unless the focused Reading suites pass together:
  `packages/pipelines/asset-pack` Read-Need and depository-search tests,
  `packages/pipeline-hosts` manifest/harness/host tests, UAPI read-review,
  pipeline-harness route/preflight, Terminal harness stream, vector search
  tests, and `protocol-demonstration` local fit-finding tests.
- The coverage set must be updated whenever a Reading phase, agent, tool,
  PTRR step, ThricifiedGeneration id, telemetry field, algorithmic scoring rule, fee formula,
  settlement boundary, or source-disclosure rule changes. Specification text,
  tests, and core algorithmic design must move together; deficiencies found by
  tests require either implementation repair or explicit SPEC correction before
  gate acceptance.
- A mocked pipeline phase is acceptable only as a typed contract witness. It
  must emit the same phase id, agent id, PTRR step id, ThricifiedGeneration ids, tool name, prompt
  input, interpolated context, model output posture, parsed output type,
  timing/usage shape, result state, and fail-closed errors expected from the
  real phase. Tests must reject untyped placeholders that could hide live
  pipeline drift.

### Long-running full-profile pipeline gate

The current V28 route-streaming gate uses
`BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE_PROFILE=bounded` because the Vercel Function
route can stream live progress and collect artifacts only inside its request
window. `BITCODE_ASSET_PACK_REAL_INFERENCE_PROFILE=full` is scoped to a
subsequent V28 gate.

That later gate may run for dozens of minutes in Vercel Sandbox. The sandbox
pipeline command must push finished result state, artifacts, and readback
signals to a server-side stream/socket handler or durable queue; the route that
starts the run must not be responsible for waiting synchronously for the final
result. The push must be correlated by the pipeline run id, authenticated
without exposing Vercel/OAI/Supabase/GitHub secrets inside routine telemetry,
idempotent across retries, and durable before the sandbox stops. Terminal must
be able to reattach by run id and stream both in-flight events and final
artifact/readback state after the starter HTTP request has ended.

Full-profile acceptance requires the same evidence as bounded profile plus
durable async completion delivery, resumable status readback, explicit timeout
and retry accounting, and Terminal reattachment to the live pipeline stream.
Until that gate exists, `full` is a preflight blocker on the deployed route and
`bounded` remains the current staging-testnet profile for closing the
source-bound Read/Fit -> AssetPack -> Finish -> ledger readback gate.

## proof-family canon

V28 inherits the Bitcode proof-family canon and adds commercial Protocol/Terminal MVP QA plus Terminal readiness productization members.

## generated canon

BITCODE_SPEC_V28_PROVEN.md must render aggregate proof verdict, exact proof-family inventory, exact per-family member inventory, exact per-family theorem inventory, exact replay-step inventories and theorem bindings, witness artifact inventories, generated artifact inventories, scenario and run coverage matrices, proof-source commit, and fail closed when a required family is missing.

### Canonical regeneration and fail-closed posture

Canonical regeneration must fail closed when files, proof roots, route scans, or validation commands disagree.

## Appendix D. Validation and checking gate catalog

Required validation includes:

- `node scripts/check-bitcode-spec-family.mjs --version V28 --mode draft --current-target V27`
- `node scripts/check-bitcode-canon-posture-drift.mjs --active-canon V27 --draft-target V28`
- `find uapi/app/api -path '*v[0-9]*' -print | sort`
- `jq empty .bitcode/v28-*.json`
- package/API/ORM/protocol-demonstration tests
- Terminal UI and browser checks
- `pnpm -C uapi build`
- `git diff --check`

## Appendix E. Current canonical source map

Current canonical source map:

- active canon: `BITCODE_SPEC_V27.md`
- active proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V27_PROVEN.md`
- draft target: `BITCODE_SPEC_V28.md`
- source-bearing package: `packages/btd/src`
- route owners: `packages/api/src/routes/btd-crypto.ts` and `uapi/app/api/btd/*`
- Terminal route surface: `/terminal` through `uapi/app/terminal`
- Terminal implementation module: `uapi/app/terminal`
- AssetPack range surface: `uapi/app/btd/[assetPackId]`
- MCP API and ChatGPT App surfaces: V28 MVP interface ingress over Protocol/Terminal truth
- witness runtime: `protocol-demonstration`

## Appendix F. Subsystem totality and derivability matrix

Subsystem totality covers repo supply and depositing; reading and measured demand; prompt/inference/evaluator ownership; deposit-to-read fit; recall and ranking; verification decisions; selection and materialization; branch artifacts and assetPackEvidence; identity, authority, signing, and policy; sensitive data and confidentiality flows; projection, disclosure, and redaction; proof families, members, theorems, witnesses, and replay; settlement, source-to-shares, journals, and exact accounting; telemetry, persistence, state, and failure semantics; host/runtime capability truth; operator experience and pedagogy; validation and test stack; generated artifacts and canonical promotion.

## Appendix G. Canonical file-family and promotion contract catalog

The V28 file family is `BITCODE_SPEC_V28.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_NOTES.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, and eventual `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_PROVEN.md`.

Promotion updates `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` only after V28 proof closure.

## Appendix H. Operator surface and quality contract catalog

Operator surfaces must render Terminal wallet, BTC fee, Read, Fit, AssetPack range, read-right, journal, reconciliation, and operational-health state with scan-readable quality.

## Appendix I. Scenario, workflow, and cross-product contract catalog

Required scenario vocabulary includes auth-issuer-rollback, privacy-boundary-proof-export, polyglot-gateway-benchmark-remediation, auth-many-asset-normalization, Targeted deposit, Normalization deposit, patch, context, public, buyer, reviewer, internal, Openly writable, Measurably readable, Provable, and Valuable.

## Appendix J. Fail-closed contract and error posture matrix

Fail-closed cases include invalid deposit, prompt contract incompleteness, parsed-envelope inadmissibility, no-survivor asset pack, authorization denial, public projection overexposure, settlement conservation drift, and stale promoted status truth.

## Appendix K. Source-bearing AssetPack and artifact contract catalog

Source-bearing AssetPack artifacts include `.bitcode/asset-pack.lock.json`, `.bitcode/selected-source-material.json`, `.bitcode/verification-report.json`, `.bitcode/source-to-shares.json`, `.bitcode/projection-policy.json`, `.bitcode/system-proof-bundle.json`, and `BITCODE_SPEC_V28_PROVEN.md`.
