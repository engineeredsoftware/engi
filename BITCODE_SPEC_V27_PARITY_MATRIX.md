## Judgment Legend

- `implemented baseline`: present from V26 and suitable as a V27 starting point.
- `partial`: present but not complete enough for V27 closure.
- `gap`: absent or insufficient for V27.
- `deferred`: intentionally later-version work.
- `blocking`: must close before V27 promotion.

## V27 Source Parity Matrix

| Aggregate holding read | users can read current holding posture | `getBtdBalance`, `readBtdHoldings`, user/auxillary APIs read compatibility storage | partial | replace aggregate read with registry-derived read |
| Compatibility storage | old `user_credits` names are storage carriers only | ORM wraps `user_credits` and `user_credit_usages` as non-canonical compatibility read corridors; docs and tests assert they cannot mint, debit, transfer, or settle `$BTD` | partial | Gate 6 noncanonical binding is closed; later product reads still need registry-derived replacement |
| Organization treasury | organization can aggregate holdings | `OrganizationBtdTreasuryModel` aggregates member `user_credits` balances | partial | treasury must read registry holdings and never mint |

| Receipt schemas | receipts exist for deposit, licensed bundle, allocation, settlement fit quality, V27 crypto primitives | `packages/btd/src/receipts.ts`, `packages/btd/src/allocation.ts`, and `protocol-demonstration/src/receipt-schemas.js` now cover V27 mint and contributor allocation receipts with replay validation | partial | Gate 5 package/demonstration receipt replay closure is proved; add persisted receipt coverage and generated total proof families later |
| Mint admission | only Need-Fit-Prove-Settle can mint | `packages/btd/src/range.ts` and `packages/api/src/routes/btd-crypto.ts` enforce accepted Need, accepted Fit, required roots, access policy, and positive Exchange sequence before range allocation or mint-draft return; package/API tests prove negative paths | partial | Gate 4 package/API admission closure is proved; integrate package guard into persisted Terminal/Exchange write paths and generated proof families in later gates |

| Versioned route removal | current app API routes are in-place and unversioned | former version-prefixed corridors are now `uapi/app/api/external-realization` and `uapi/app/api/executors/[interfaceId]`; `find uapi/app/api -path '*v[0-9]*'` returns no routes | closed | future versions must update routes in place |
| UAPI balance widget | top-right balance distinguishes BTC and `$BTD` | `btd-tracker.tsx` shows BTC and `$BTD`; acquisition intent stores Terminal Need and Exchange existing-`$BTD` paths as V27 | closed | registry/range live reads can deepen later |

| --- | --- | --- |
| V27 SPEC, DELTA, NOTES, and PARITY files exist | `BITCODE_SPEC_V27.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V27_DELTA.md`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V27_NOTES.md`, and this matrix are present | closed |
| V26 remained the active canonical pointer at Gate 1 | `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` contained `V26` during Gate 1 | closed |
| audited surfaces are listed in the parity matrix | Audit basis and source map list the V27 spec family, package, API, ORM, migration, UAPI, MCP, demonstration, and proof-slice surfaces used for the baseline | closed |
| parity rows classify source truth | matrix rows used `implemented baseline`, `partial`, `gap`, `deferred`, and `blocking` judgments during draft audit | closed |
| no generated proof claim is made before proof artifacts exist | `.bitcode/v27-gate-1-source-audit-proof.json` records only source-audit closure; generated proof appendix is a Gate 16 artifact | closed |

## Gate 2 Closure Evidence

Gate 2 is closed as of the V27 ontology and hard-cap pass.
This does not close later registry, persistence, range-proof, access-policy UI, or generated-proof-family work.

| Gate 2 expectation | Closure evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$BTD` cell/range ontology is complete in SPEC | `BITCODE_SPEC_V27.md` defines supply state, cell/range model, mint lifecycle, measureminting, access rights, and non-fungible semantics | closed |
| `BTD_MAX_MINTABLE_SUPPLY = 21_000_000` is package-owned | `packages/btd/src/constants.ts` owns the constant and `packages/btd/src/index.ts` exports it through the package boundary | closed |
| tests prove cap existence and overflow rejection | `packages/btd/__tests__/btd.test.ts` proves the 21,000,000 ceiling and overflow rejection | closed |

## Gate 3 Closure Evidence

Gate 3 is closed as of the V27 package supply/range primitive pass.
This does not close DB persistence, generated no-overlap proof families, persisted Exchange write paths, or V27 promotion.

| Gate 3 expectation | Closure evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |

| range allocation exists | `packages/btd/src/range.ts` defines `allocateAssetPackRange` over validated mint admission and supply state | closed |
| one AssetPack receives one primary contiguous range | `assertAssetPackRangePlacement` rejects a second primary range for the same `assetPackId`; package tests cover duplicate primary range rejection | closed |
| no overlap is possible through package tests | `assertAssetPackRangePlacement` rejects stale-state overlapping ranges; package tests cover overlap rejection | closed |
| invalid input fails closed | `assertMintAdmission`, `assertAssetPackRangeIntegrity`, and supply cap checks reject invalid roots, token counts, volume, stale state, and cap overflow before returning an allocation | closed |
| replay can derive `nextTokenId` | `replayBtdMintReceipts` derives `nextTokenId` from sequential mint receipts; package tests prove replay reaches the expected next token id | closed |

## Gate 4 Closure Evidence

Gate 4 is closed as of the V27 package/API mint-admission pass.
This does not close persisted Exchange writes, generated V27 proof-family closure, ledger finality, or V27 promotion.

| Gate 4 expectation | Closure evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mint request requires accepted Need, accepted Fit, proof root, source root, dedupe root, settlement root, access policy, and Exchange sequence | `packages/btd/src/range.ts` and `packages/api/src/routes/btd-crypto.ts` validate the admission roots before range allocation or mint-draft return | closed |
| negative tests prove no mint before settlement | package tests reject absent Need, absent Fit, missing proof root, missing settlement root, and non-positive Exchange sequence; API route tests reject absent Need, absent Fit, missing proof root, and non-positive Exchange sequence | closed |
| source-to-shares proof artifacts include minted range roots | `.bitcode/v27-source-to-shares-mint-admission-proof.json` carries `mintedRangeRoot`, range boundaries, source root, proof root, settlement root, Exchange root, policy hash, supply replay root, and Terminal receipt roots | closed |
| Terminal intent can point to the path without bypassing it | `buildBtdMintDraft` emits Terminal journal entries only after admission, measurement, measureminting, range allocation, mint receipt, and optional contributor allocation; API tests assert exchange sequence and receipt roots | closed |

## Gate 5 Closure Evidence

Gate 5 is closed as of the V27 package and demonstration receipt replay pass.
This does not close persisted Exchange receipt writes, database projection replay, ledger finality, generated total proof-family closure, or V27 promotion.

| Gate 5 expectation | Closure evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BtdMintReceipt` schema exists | `packages/btd/src/receipts.ts` defines and validates the V27 mint receipt; `protocol-demonstration/src/receipt-schemas.js` exposes `btd_asset_pack_mint` with the V27 receipt family posture | closed |
| replay reconstructs prior supply, range, allocation, and next supply | `packages/btd/src/replay.ts` reconstructs supply checkpoints, AssetPack ranges, contributor allocation receipts, total minted supply, and `nextTokenId`; package tests prove the exact reconstructed state | closed |
| mutation tests reject altered cap, altered range, missing root, missing policy, and non-conserved allocation | package tests block missing proof root, altered range boundary, altered max supply, missing access policy hash, and non-conserved allocation; demonstration tests block missing proof root | closed |
| proof generator includes V27 receipt replay | `.bitcode/v27-receipt-replay-proof.json` records the proof slice and `protocol-demonstration/test/v27-crypto-primitives.test.js` includes the V27 demonstration receipt replay assertion | closed |

## Gate 6 Closure Evidence

Gate 6 is closed as of the V27 Exchange persistence migration and ORM boundary pass.
This does not close live Supabase migration execution, generated DB type refresh, wallet/ledger finality, or value-bearing rollout.

| Gate 6 expectation | Closure evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| migration creates or plans the registry/projection table family | `supabase/migrations/002_v27_btd_crypto_registry.sql` creates supply, semantic-volume, measuremint, range, cell, mint receipt, ownership, read-license, allocation, ancestry, licensed-read revenue, fee, anchor, order, transfer, journal, reconciliation, upgrade, and telemetry tables | closed |
| SQL constraints cover cap, uniqueness, no overlap, access policy, and service-role mutation | migration enforces cap, unique token/range identities, GiST no-overlap range exclusion, access-policy checks, and RLS-enabled service-role-only projection writes | closed |
| ORM exposes Bitcode-native model names | `BtdRegistryModel` exposes Bitcode-native registry methods and `btdRegistry` is available from ORM clients | closed |
| `user_credits` is no longer canonical tokenomics truth | compatibility balance/transaction models and database docs state those storage carriers are noncanonical read corridors only and cannot mint, debit, transfer, or settle `$BTD` | closed |

2. Integrate semantic-volume/range/mint admission into source-to-shares settlement.
3. Apply/test V27 migration and refresh generated Supabase types.
4. Broaden DB route-write tests from closed V27 registry rows into live migration execution and generated DB type refresh.
5. Add remaining range/policy UI disclosure surfaces beyond the current access route and Auxillary pane.
6. Add live wallet adapter UX and value-bearing PSBT provider credentials.
7. Add regtest and signet broadcaster/observer harnesses.
8. Connect production alert sinks and live value-bearing operator credentials.
9. Complete dispute holdback persistence and live route consumption.
10. Complete web research rebinding for selected crypto standards and libraries.

## Promotion Risk

The highest-risk V27 gap is not the cap.
The cap already exists.

The highest-risk gaps are:

- defining normalized Bitcode volume precisely enough to drive mint count;
- proving semantic-volume measurement resists byte/tokenizer/fragmentation inflation;
- moving from aggregate compatibility balances to registry cell/range state;
- proving live value-bearing BTC fee transactions and ledgerized AssetPack anchors beyond the closed receipt/provider boundary;
- rebinding selected crypto libraries from current primary-source research;
- reconciling external ledger finality with Bitcode database and private canonical facts;
- proving minimal Exchange transfers without reintroducing fungible `$BTD` balance semantics;
- avoiding legal overclaim in read-right UI;
- proving allocation conservation;
- keeping ancestry useful without creating rent-seeking by age or broad claims.
