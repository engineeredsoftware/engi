-- Saved query name: v48_qa_05_track1_readiness_rollup
-- Purpose: one-row Track 1 identity summary — session, identity, profile,
-- wallet binding, GitHub installation, repository count.
-- Run: anytime; the quick "where does Track 1 stand" check.
-- Expect (Track 1 complete): session_minted true, wallet binding populated,
-- github_installation_id present, repository_count > 0.
