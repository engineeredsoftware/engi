# Bitcode Spec V30 Parity Matrix

## Status

- Version: `V30`
- V30 state: draft target parity matrix opened for Protocol/BTD hardening
- Current canonical/latest target: `V29`
- Prior canonical anchor: `BITCODE_SPEC_V29.md`
- Prior generated proof appendix: `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_PROVEN.md`
- Generated structured artifact inventory: none for V30 yet; V30 gates must create and validate generated artifacts before promotion
- Source parity state: V30 parity begins with roadmap/gating, then hardens package APIs, Bitcoin/PSBT, BTD receipts, ledger projection, source-to-shares proof, bridge-readiness boundaries, telemetry/proof hooks, interface regression, and promotion readiness
- State: draft target parity matrix opened
- Active canonical pointer during draft opening: `BITCODE_SPEC.txt` -> `V29`
- Scope: V30 parity ledger for Protocol/BTD hardening over promoted V29
- Spec companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V30.md`
- Notes companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V30_NOTES.md`
- Delta companion: `BITCODE_SPEC_V30_DELTA.md`
- Generated proof appendix: none until V30 promotion
- Last fully realized canonical target preserved in source: `V29`

## Purpose

The V30 parity matrix prevents Protocol/BTD hardening from becoming vague infrastructure work.
Each gate must name package boundaries, implementation surfaces, tests, generated/proof artifacts, documentation, accepted non-goals, and promotion evidence before it closes.

## Audit basis

Gate 1 audit basis:

- `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V29.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_DELTA.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_NOTES.md`

- `BITCODE_SPEC_V29_PROVEN.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V30.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V30_DELTA.md`
- `BITCODE_SPEC_V30_NOTES.md`

## V30 implementation matrix

| Area | Gate | Source evidence | Judgment | Closure requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Draft family and branch posture | Gate 1 | `BITCODE_SPEC_V30.md`, DELTA, NOTES, PARITY, `BITCODE_SPEC.txt`, branch `v30/gate-1-roadmap-and-gating` | drafted | V30 family validates in draft mode over active V29 and `check:v30-gate1` passes. |
| Roadmap truth | Gate 1 | `SPECIFICATIONS_ROADMAP.md`, README, PR template, workflow posture | drafted | Roadmap states V29 active, V30 draft, and coherent V31-V37 responsibilities. |
| Protocol package API boundaries | Gate 2 | `packages/btd/src/api-boundaries.ts`, `packages/api/src/routes/btd-crypto.ts`, package READMEs/tests | drafted | Shared Protocol/BTD objects have package-owned builders, parsers, validators, JSON-safe serializers, and tests. |
| Bitcoin Taproot PSBT fee rigor | Gate 3 | `packages/btd/src/btc-fee-operation.ts`, `packages/btd/src/bitcoin-fees.ts`, BTD/API tests, gate checker | drafted | BTC fee and signer states are typed, testnet/mainnet-safe, no-custody, Taproot/PSBT aware, and proof-rooted. |
| BTD AssetPack mint/read receipts | Gate 4 | `packages/btd/src/receipts.ts`, `packages/btd/src/api-boundaries.ts`, asset-pack harness evidence, Terminal detail snapshot/read model tests, gate checker | drafted | Mint, read, and rights-transfer receipts bind BTD range, preview, paid unlock, delivery, and ledger projection. |
| Testnet ledger projection hardening | Gate 5 | `packages/btd/src/reconciliation.ts`, API route tests, asset-pack harness evidence, Terminal journal reconciliation UI/tests, gate checker | drafted | Ledger/database/object-storage/private facts are distinct; staging-testnet readback is secret-free; drift, quarantine, retry, and unlock blocking are tested. |
| Source-to-shares proof cleanup | Gate 6 | `packages/btd/src/source-to-shares.ts`, API route boundary, focused BTD/API tests, gate checker | drafted | Measurement contribution, fee allocation, zero-cell/refit tail, ancestry evidence, and conservation invariants are testable. |
| Bridge-readiness research boundaries | Gate 7 | `packages/btd/src/bridge-readiness.ts`, BTD/API tests, route boundary, docs, gate checker | drafted | Bridge paths are typed research-only records until admitted by explicit future proof and policy. |
| Protocol telemetry/proof hooks | Gate 8 | `packages/btd/src/telemetry.ts`, API route boundary, focused BTD/API tests, gate checker | drafted | Receipts, fee states, projections, source-to-shares proofs, and bridge-readiness posture emit source-safe telemetry and proof hooks. |
| Interface integration regression | Gate 9 | Terminal/API/MCP/ChatGPT App adapters and tests | pending | Existing interfaces consume package-owned objects without regressing V29 behavior. |
| Promotion readiness | Gate 10 | V30 promotion workflow, generated `.bitcode/v30-*`, `BITCODE_SPEC_V30_PROVEN.md` | pending | `version/v30` can promote to `main` only after all V30 checks pass and promotion automation can commit generated canon. |

## completion condition

Gate 1 is complete when the V30 draft family validates, `check:v30-gate1` passes, workflow posture is V30-aware, README and roadmap reflect V30 initiation, V31-V37 scopes are current enough to guide future gates, diff hygiene passes, and the gate branch is committed and pushed for review into `version/v30`.
